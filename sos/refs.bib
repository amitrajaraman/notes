	abstract={A lower bound is established on degrees of Positivstellensatz calculus refutations (over a real field) introduced in (Grigoriev {\&} Vorobjov 2001; Grigoriev 2001) for the knapsack problem. The bound depends on the values of coefficients of an instance of the knapsack problem: for certain values the lower bound is linear and for certain values the upper bound is constant, while in the polynomial calculus the degree is always linear (regardless of the values of coefficients) (Impagliazzo et al. 1999). This shows that the Positivstellensatz calculus can be strictly stronger than the polynomial calculus from the point of view of the complexity of the proofs.},

	abstract = {Restricting the search space {0,1}n to the set of truth tables of “easy” Boolean functions on logn variables, as well as using some known hardness–randomness tradeoffs, we establish a number of results relating the complexity of exponential-time and probabilistic polynomial-time complexity classes. In particular, we show that NEXP⊂P/poly⇔NEXP=MA; this can be interpreted as saying that no derandomization of MA (and, hence, of promise-BPP) is possible unless NEXP contains a hard Boolean function. We also prove several downward closure results for ZPP, RP, BPP, and MA; e.g., we show EXP=BPP⇔EE=BPE, where EE is the double-exponential time class and BPE is the exponential-time analogue of BPP.}
