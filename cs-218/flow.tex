\section{Flow}

Where there are graphs, we tend to see flow networks quite a lot.

\begin{fdef}[Flow Network]
	A directed graph $G=(V,E)$ together with a \textit{capacity} function $c:E\to\Zp$, a designated \textit{source} $s$, and a designated \textit{sink} $t$ is known as a \textit{flow network}.
\end{fdef}

We shall assume that there are no edges entering $s$ and no edges leaving $t$.\\
We can think of $s$ as a source of water, with the intermediate edges being pipes that have some limit to how much they can carry and the intermediate nodes being junctions that transmit water, and $t$ as a reservoir.

The main question we wish to answer is:
\begin{quote}
	What is the maximum rate that can be sent from the source to the sink without violating any capacity constraints?
\end{quote}

This is modelled more concretely using the following definition.

\begin{fdef}[Flow]
	A \textit{flow} in a flow network is a function $f:E\to\R^{\geq 0}$ that satisfies
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Capacity constraints: For each $e\in E$, $f(e)\leq c(e)$.
		\item Flow conservation: For each $v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}$,
		\[ \sum_{\vv{uv}\in E} f(\vv{uv}) = \sum_{\vv{vw}\in E} f(\vv{vw}). \]
	\end{itemize}
	The \textit{value of the flow} $f$, denoted $|f|$, is given by
	\[ |f| = \sum_{\vv{sv}\in E} f(\vv{sv}). \]
\end{fdef}

The flow conservation rule written above is also known as \textit{Kirchhoff's law}. For the sake of brevity, we denote
\begin{align*}
	f^{\ot}(v) &= \sum_{\vv{uv}\in E} f(\vv{uv}) \text{ and} \\
	f^{\to}(v) &= \sum_{\vv{vw}\in E} f(\vv{vw}).
\end{align*}
We then have $|f|=f^{\to}(s)$.\\
For any $U\subseteq V$, we use $f^{\ot}(U)$ and $f^{\to}(U)$ to denote the flow from $V\setminus U$ to $U$ and $U$ to $V\setminus U$ respectively.

\begin{lemma}
	For any flow $f$ on a flow network with source $s$ and sink $t$,
	\[ |f| = \sum_{\vv{sv}\in E}f(\vv{sv}) = f^{\to}(s) = \sum_{\vv{vt}\in E}f(\vv{vt}) = f^{\ot}(t). \]
\end{lemma}
