\section{Notation and Prerequisites}
	
	Given $n \in \N$, $[n]$ denotes the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and $[n]_0$ denotes the set $[n] \cup \{0\}$.\\
	$S(n,k)$, a Stirling number of the second kind, is the number of partitions of $[n]$ into exactly $k$ parts. $s(n,k)$, a Stirling number of the first kind, is the number of permutations of $[n]$ with exactly $k$ cycles.\\
	Given a graph $G$ and edge $e\in G$, $G-e$ is the graph obtained by deleting $e$ (it has the same vertex set), and $G\setminus e$ is the graph obtained by ``contracting'' $e$, that is, merging the two vertices of $e$ and having a vertex adjacent to the new vertex if they are adjacent to either of the earlier vertices.
