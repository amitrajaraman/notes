\subsection*{References}

The only reference to be used is the mentor's notes for representation theory which can be found \href{https://aryamanmaithani.github.io/math/rep-theory/Notes.pdf}{here}, with some possible reference to the cited book, namely \emph{Representation Theory of Finite Groups} by Benjamin Steinberg.

\subsection*{Tentative Schedule}

I plan to cover sections 1 (Group representations), 2 (Character Theory and Orthogonality Relations), 3 (The Dimension Theorem), and 7 (Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups). If time permits and I am ahead of schedule, I will additionally cover section 8 (Burnside's Theorems).

The schedule is as follows:\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	Week 1 & Section 1.1 \\
	Week 2 & Sections 1.2, 2.1 \\
	Week 3 & Sections 2.2, 2.3 \\
	Week 4 & Section 2.4 \\
	Week 5 & Sections 2.5, 2.6 \\
	Week 6 & Sections 3, 7.1, 7.2 \\
	Week 7 & Sections 7.3 to 7.5 \\
	Week 8 & Wrapping up the report and video presentation \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
