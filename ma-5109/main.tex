\section{Notation}
	
	We use $[n]$ to represent $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$.\\
	For integers $a$ and $b$, $[a,b]$ means $\{a,a+1,\ldots,b\}$.\\
	A graph $G_n$ is a graph with $n$ vertices.\\
	Given a graph $G$, $e(G)$ is the number of edges $G$ has.\\
	For a vertex $v$, denote by $N(v)$ the set of \emph{neighbours} of $v$ -- all the vertices that have an edge to $v$.\\
	For a vertex $v$, denote by $d_G(v) = |N(v)|$ the \emph{degree} of $v$ -- the number of edges incident on it. If the graph $G$ is clear from context, we write simply $d(V)$. \\
	For $v \in V$ and $K \subseteq V$, $d(v,K)$ is the number of edges
	\[ \left|\{ u \in K : uv \in E \}\right| \]
	from $v$ into $K$.

\section{Introduction}

	\subsection{Basic Definitions}

		\begin{fdef}
			A (simple undirected) \textbf{graph} $G$ is an ordered pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a finite set called the \emph{vertex set} and $E$, called the \emph{edge set}, is a subset of $\binom{V}{2}$, where $\binom{S}{k}$ represents the set of all $k$-element subsets of $S$.
		\end{fdef}

		We typically represent graphs pictorially, showing vertices as dots and edges as arcs joining the vertices present in the corresponding subset.

		A few important graphs are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item the \emph{null graph} with vertex set $V$, where $E = \emptyset$.
			\item the \emph{complete graph} $K_n$, where $V = [n]$ and $E = \binom{[n]}{2}$.
			\item the \emph{complete bipartite graph} $K_{m,n}$, where $V = A \cup B$ with $|A|=m$, $|B|=n$, and $A,B$ are disjoint, and $E = \{\{a,b\} : a \in A, b \in B\}$.
			\item the \emph{path graph} of length $n$, where $V = [n+1]$ and $E = \{\{m,m+1\} : m \in [n]\}$.
			\item the \emph{cycle} of length $n$, where $V = [n]$ and $E = \{\{l,m\} : l,m\in [n] , (m - l) \equiv 1 \pmod{n}\}$.
		\end{itemize}

		Now, consider the graph $G$ with vertex set $[4]$ and edge set $\{\{1,3\},\{3,2\},\{2,4\}\}$. This graph appears to be the same as the path graph of length $3$, but how do we make this correspondence more concrete?\\
		Relabeling vertices doesn't create a ``new'' graph.

		\begin{fdef}[Graph Isomorphism]
			Two graphs $G = (V,E)$ and $G' = (V',E')$ are said to be \textbf{isomorphic} and we write $G \simeq G'$ if there exists a bijection $f : V \to V'$ such that there is an edge between two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ if and only if there is an edge between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ in $G'$.
		\end{fdef}

		If two graphs are isomorphic, they are identical for our purposes (we only care about graphs up to isomorphism).

		We now give a few more definitions that are useful.

		\begin{fdef}[Subgraph]
			Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a \textbf{subgraph} $H = (V',E')$ is a graph such that $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$. Given $V' \subseteq V$, the subgraph \emph{induced} by $V'$ on $G$ is that with vertex set $V'$ and edge set $\binom{V'}{2} \cap E$.
		\end{fdef}

		\begin{fdef}[$r$-partite Graph]
			A graph $G = (V,E)$ is said to be \textbf{$r$-partite} if there exists a partition $V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_r$ of $V$ such that for any edge $e = uv \in E$, $u$ and $v$ are in distinct $V_i$. That is, there are no edges within any of the $V_i$.\\
			In particular, a $2$-partite graph is said to be \textbf{bipartite}.
		\end{fdef}

		\begin{fdef}[Independent Set]
			Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, $I \subseteq V$ is said to be \textbf{independent} if no two vertices of $I$ are adjacent (the subgraph induced by $I$ is null).\\
			$\alpha(G)$, the \emph{independence number} of $G$, denotes the size of the largest independent set in $G$.
		\end{fdef}

		\begin{fdef}[Clique]
			Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, $K \subseteq V$ is said to be a \textbf{clique} if any two vertices of $K$ are adjacent (the subgraph induced by $I$ is complete).
			$\omega(G)$, the \emph{clique number} of $G$, denotes the size of the largest clique in $G$.
		\end{fdef}

		\begin{fdef}[Complement Graph]
			Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, the \textbf{complement graph} of $G$ is $\bar{G} = (V,\binom{V}{2} \setminus E)$.
		\end{fdef}

		Observe that $S \subseteq V$ is independent in $G$ if and only if $S$ is a clique in $\bar{G}$. In particular, $\alpha(G) = \omega(\bar{G})$.

	\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$K_{r+1}$}{K r+1}-free graphs}

		Extremal graph theory is motivated by the following simple problem:

		\begin{quote}
			At most how many edges can a graph $G_n$ have if it contains no triangles?
		\end{quote}

		More precisely, what is
		\[ \max_{\substack{\text{no subgraph of $G_n$} \\ \text{is isomorphic to $K_3$}}} e(G_n)? \]

		Clearly, this number is well-defined since a graph on $n$ vertices cannot have more than $\binom{n}{2}$ vertices.

		A simple observation is that any complete bipartite graph has no triangles: if there were a triangle, then two vertices would be in the same ``part'', which contradicts the existence of edges only between the two parts.\\
		As a consequence, for any $1 \le m \le n$, it is possible to construct $m \times (n-m)$ edges (with this bound being attained for $K_{m,n-m}$). In particular, it is possible to construct a graph with $\lfloor n^2 / 4 \rfloor$ edges.

		\begin{ftheo}[Mantel's Theorem]
		\label{Mantel's Theorem}
			If $G_n$ has no triangle, then
			\[ e(G_n) \le \left\lfloor \frac{n^2}{4} \right\rfloor. \]
			Further, equality is attained iff $G_n \simeq K_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor , \lceil n/2 \rceil}$.
		\end{ftheo}
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose $G_n$ has no triangles. Saying that $G_n$ has no triangles is equivalent to saying that for distinct adjacent $u,v$, $N(u) \cap N(v) = \emptyset$.\\
			So, $d(u) + d(v) \le n$. Therefore,
			\begin{align*}
				ne(G_n) &\stackrel{\small{(1)}}{\ge} \sum_{uv \in E} d(u) + d(v) \\
					&= \sum_{uv \in E} |N(u) \cup N(v)| \\
					&= \left| (e, w) : e = uv \in E, w \in N(u) \cup N(v) \right| \\
					&= \sum_{u\in V} |\{ (e , w) : w \in N(u) , e = uv \in E \}| \\
					&= \sum_{u \in V} |\{ (v,w) : v,w \in N(u) \}| \\
					&\stackrel{\small{(2)}}{=} \sum_{u \in V} d(u)^2 \\
					&\stackrel{\small{(3)}}{\ge} \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{u \in V} d(u) \right)^2 \\
					&\stackrel{\small{(4)}}{=} \frac{4 e(G_n)^2}{n},
			\end{align*}
			where $(2)$ follows from the changing the main thing being summed over to $u$, the ``middle'' vertex in the $L$-like structure, $(3)$ follows from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy-Schwarz_inequality}{Cauchy-Schwarz inequality}, and $(3)$ follows from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking_lemma}{handshaking lemma}.\\

			What happens when equality is attained? Let us look at the case where $n$ is even.\\
			$(1)$ is only tight when $d(u) + d(v) = n$ for all edges $uv$ and $(3)$ is only tight when $d(u)$ is a constant (independent of $u$). This implies that $d(u) = \frac{n}{2}$ for every $u\in V$. Now, if $uv$ is an edge, $N(u) \cap N(v) = \emptyset$ implies that $N(u) \cup N(v) = V$, and so $G_n = K_{\frac{n}{2}, \frac{n}{2}}$.\\
			The case where $n$ is odd is analyzed similarly, with slight nuances in $(3)$ since exact equality is not attained.
		\end{proof}
		
		While the above is one of the early results in extremal graph theory, the subject was only really born due to Tur\'{a}n in the following result.

		\begin{ftheo}[Tur\'{a}n's Thoerem]
			If $G_n$ has no $K_{r+1}$ ($r \ge 2$), then $e(G_n) \le t_r(n)$, with equality attained iff $G \simeq T_r(n)$.
		\end{ftheo}

		The version for $r=2$ is just a triangle-free graph and is the same as \nameref{Mantel's Theorem}. In the proof of this, we split the vertex set into two parts and dumped all the edges between these parts.\\
		If we want to avoid $K_4$ ($r=3$), then perhaps we could split the vertex set into three parts and dump all the edges between these parts.\\
		In general, we want to partition $V$ of size $n$ into $r$ ``almost equal'' parts and set only those edges between vertices in distinct parts -- such a graph is known as the \textbf{Tur\'{a}n graph} $T_r(n)$ and the number of edges $e(T_r(n))$ is the \textbf{Tur\'{a}n number} $t_r(n)$.\\
		In particular, when $r \mid n$,
		\[ t_r(n) = \binom{r}{2} \left(\frac{n}{r}\right)^2 = \frac{n^2}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{r}\right). \]


		Here, we give three proofs of Tur\'{a}n's Theorem.

		\begin{proof}[Proof of Tur\'{a}n's Theorem]
			We perform strong induction on $n+r$. We have already proved the result for $r=2$.\\
			Suppose $e(G_n) \ge t_r(n)$ and $G_n$ is $K_{r+1}$-free, where $r > 2$. We wish to prove that $G \simeq T_r(n)$.\\
			Since $t_r(n) \ge t_{r-1}(n)$ (check this!), the inductive hypothesis implies that $G$ has a copy $K \subseteq V$ of $K_r$. Observe that for $v \not\in K$, $d(v,K) \le r-1$ -- otherwise, there would be a copy of $K_{r+1}$ in $G$.\\
			As a result, $e(V \setminus K, K) \le (r-1)(n-r)$. By the induction hypothesis, $e(V\setminus K, V\setminus K) \le t_r(n-r)$. Therefore,
			\[ t_r(n) \le e(G_n) \le t_r(n-r) + (r-1)(n-r) + \binom{r}{2}. \]
			However, as can be checked manually, $t_r(n-r) + (r-1)(n-r) + \binom{r}{2} = t_r(n)$!\\
			It follows that equality holds everywhere -- $e(G_n) = t_r(n)$, $e(V \setminus K) = t_r(n-r)$, and $d(v,K) = r-1$ for all $v \in V \setminus K$.\\
			This graph is then isomorphic to $T_r(n)$ -- for each $v \in V \setminus K$, we can put the vertex in $K$ that is not adjacent to $v$ in the same bucket as $v$. Then, the only edges are those between distinct buckets (Why?), so $G_n \simeq T_r(n)$.
		\end{proof}

		\begin{proof}[Erd\H{o}s' Proof of Tur\'{a}n's Theorem]
			Erd\H{o}s proves a slightly more general claim: given a $K_{r+1}$-free graph $G_n$, there exists an $r$-partite graph $H$ on $V$ such that $d_G(v) \le d_H(v)$ for all $v \in V$.\\
			It is then a simple task to check that among the $r$-partite graphs on $n$ vertices, the Tur\'{a}n graph $T_r(n)$ has the most edges.\\

			To prove our claim, we perform induction on $r$.\\
			The claim is trivial for the base case $r=1$.\\
			Now, suppose the claim holds for values less than $r$. Let $v_0 \in V$ such that $d_G(v_0) = \max_{v \in V} d_G(v)$ (the vertex of maximum degree in $G$) and $W = N(z)$. Since $G$ is $K_{r+1}$-free, $W$ is $K_r$-free. Inductively, there is an $(r-1)$-partite graph $H'$ on $W$ such that for all $v \in W$, $d_{H'}(v) \ge d_W(v)$.\\
			Let $U = V \setminus W$. For each $u \in U$, remove all its edges in $G$ and set its new neighbour set as $W$.\\
			Our desired graph $H$ is that with these edges along with those in $H'$ and the edges from $v_0$ to $W$. That is, the $r$th part is $U \cup \{v_0\}$ and the remaining $(r-1)$ parts are those formed by $H'$. The graph is clearly $r$-partite by definition. What about the degree inequality?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item $d_G(v_0) = d_H(v_0)$ trivially.
				\item For $u \in U$, $d_H(u) = d_G(v_0) \ge d_G(u)$.
				\item For $w \in W$,
				\[ d_H(w) = |U| + 1 + d_{H'}(w) \ge |U| + 1 + d_W(w) \ge d_U(w) + 1 + d_W(w) = d_G(w). \qedhere \]
			\end{itemize}

			(Why does equality imply that the graph is isomorphic to $T_r(n)$?)
		\end{proof}

		\begin{ftheo}[Tur\'{a}n's Theorem, reformulation]
			If $d = e(G_n) / n$ is the average degree of the vertices of $G_n$, then $G_n$ has an independent set of size at least $n/(d+1)$.
		\end{ftheo}

		\begin{proof}
			Why is this equivalent to Tur\'{a}n's Theorem?\\
			If $G_n$ has no $K_{r+1}$, then $\alpha(\bar{G}) \le r$. If $\bar{G_n}$ has average degree $d$, the above result would imply that $r \ge n/(d+1)$, that is, $d \le (n/r) - 1$. The total number of edges in $G_n$ is then
			\[ \binom{n}{2} - \frac{nd}{2} \le \binom{n}{2} - \frac{n}{2} \left(\frac{n}{r} - 1\right) = \frac{n^2}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{r}\right), \]
			which gives Tur\'{a}n's bound!\\

			Let us now get to the proof of the above reformulation. First, consider the following algorithm to come up with \emph{some} independent set in $G$:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Order $V$ to get $\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$ and initialize $S = \emptyset$.
				\item Add $v_1$ to $S$.
				\item Having processed vertices $v_1$ through $v_i$, add $v_{i+1}$ to $S$ iff there is no vertex in $S$ that is adjacent to $v_{i+1}$.
			\end{enumerate}
			It is clear that this always produces an independent set, but the size of the independent set depends on the ordering we choose at the beginning.\\
			For a given ordering $\sigma$, denote by $\mathcal{A}(\sigma)$ the independent set produced by the algorithm.\\
			How do we choose a ``good'' ordering?\\
			Enter the probabilistic method. Define the random variable $\pi$ to be uniformly random on the set of all permutations of $V$. Then,
			\begin{align*}
				\expec[ | \mathcal{A}(\pi) | ] &= \expec\left[ \sum_{v \in V} \indic_{v \in \mathcal{A}(\pi)} \right] \\
				&= \sum_{v \in V} \expec\left[ \indic_{v \in \mathcal{A}(\pi)} \right] \\
				&= \sum_{v \in V} \Pr\left[ v \in \mathcal{A}(\pi) \right].
			\end{align*}
			Fix some $v \in V$ and permutation $\sigma$. What is the probability that $v \in \mathcal{A}(\sigma)$?\\
			If at the time of processing $v$ for the ordering $\sigma$, $N(v) \cap S \ne \emptyset$, then $v$ is not picked. In particular, if $v$ is the first element of $N(v) \cup \{v\}$ in the ordering $\sigma$, then it is definitely chosen by the algorithm. The probability of this occurring is $\frac{1}{d(v) + 1}$.
			So,
			\begin{align*}
				\expec[ |\mathcal{A}(\pi)| ] &= \sum_{v \in V} \Pr\left[ \indic_{v \in \mathcal{A}(\pi)} \right] \\
				&\ge \sum_{v \in V} \frac{1}{d(v) + 1} \\
				&\stackrel{\small{(*)}}{\ge} \frac{n^2}{\sum_{v \in V} (d(v) + 1)} = \frac{n}{d+1},
			\end{align*}
			% where $(*)$ follows from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality#Titu's_lemma_-_Positive_real_numbers}{Titu's Lemma}.\\
			where $(*)$ follows from the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM-GM-AM-QM_inequalities}{AM-HM inequality}.\\
			Since the expectation of $|\mathcal{A}(\pi)|$ is at least $n/(d+1)$, there must exist some permutation $\sigma$ such that $|\mathcal{A}(\sigma)| \ge n/(d+1)$, proving the result.
		\end{proof}

	\subsection{The Zarankiewicz Theorem}

		Tur\'{a}n's Theorem is the primary result that birthed Graph Theory. To generalize the notion of $K_{r+1}$-freeness, define the following.

		\begin{fdef}[Extremal Function]
			Given a graph $H$, define the \textbf{extremal function} $\exx(n;H)$ as the maximum number of edges in a graph on $n$ vertices without $H$ as a subgraph.
		\end{fdef}

		With this notation, Tur\'{a}n's Theorem then says that $\exx(n;K_{r+1}) = t_r(n)$, with equality iff $G \simeq T_r(n)$.

		\begin{fdef}
			Fix $s, t \in \N$ with $t \ge s \ge 2$ and $m,n\in\N$.
			The \textbf{Zarankiewicz function} $z(m,n;s,t)$ is the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph $G = (A \sqcup B, E)$ such that
			\begin{itemize}
				\item the two components $A$ and $B$ of the graph are of cardinality $m$ and $n$ respectively\footnote{by ``components'' of the bipartite graph we mean that for any edge $uv$ in the graph, $u\in A$ and $v\in B$ or $u \in B$ and $v\in A$.}, and
				\item there exist no $S \subseteq A$, $T \subseteq B$ with $|S|=s$, $|T|=t$, and all edges between $S$ and $T$ present in $E$.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{fdef}

		For ease of writing, we refer to the above described criterion as the \emph{Zarankiewicz condition}.

		That is, we ``forbid'' the subgraph $K_{s,t}$ with the components of size $s$ and $t$ on the side of $A$ and $B$ respectively.\\

		The \textbf{Zarankiewicz problem} asks for a closed form representation of $z(m,n;s,t)$. Failing this, for fixed $t$, it asks for a tight asymptotic bound on $z(n,n;t,t)$ as $n$ grows large.\\
		Perhaps surprisingly, this problem remains unsolved! (as of the time of writing these notes)

		\begin{ftheo}[K\H{o}v\'{a}ri-S\'{o}s-Tur\'{a}n Theorem]
			For $t\ge s\ge 2$ and $m,n\in\N$,
			$$z(m,n;s,t) \le (s-1)^{1/t} (n-t+1)m^{1-1/t} + (t-1)m.$$
		\end{ftheo}
		\begin{proof}
			Let $G$ be bipartite with vertex set $A \sqcup B$ and satisfy the Zarankiewicz condition.\\
			Fix $a \in A$. By definition, $|N(a)| = d(a)$. Now, $\binom{d(a)}{t}$ is the number of $t$-element subsets of $N(a)$. We may assume that for all $a \in A$, $d(a) \ge t-1$. Indeed, otherwise, we may add arbitrary edges to $a$ to make its degree $t-1$; any vertex from $A$ in a subgraph isomorphic to $K_{s,t}$ must have at least degree $t$ so $a$ cannot be part of it.

			We have that
			\begin{align*}
				\sum_{x \in A} \binom{d(x)}{t} &= \left| \{ (x,T) : x \in A, T \subseteq N(x), |T|=t \} \right| \\
				&= \sum_{\substack{T \subseteq B \\ |T| = t}} |\{x \in A : T \subseteq N(x)\}|.
			\end{align*}
			If we fix a $T$, then the number of such $x$ for that $T$ is at most $s-1$, due to our assumption. As a result,
			\[ \sum_{x \in A} \binom{d(x)}{t} \le \binom{n}{t} (s-1). \]
			Now, observe that the function
			\[ f(x) = \frac{x(x-1)\cdots(x-t+1)}{t!} \]
			is convex on $[t-1,\infty)$.
			Using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality#Finite_form}{Jensen's inequality} together with our assumption that $d(x) \ge t-1$ for all $x\in A$,
			\begin{align*}
				\binom{n}{t} (s-t) &\ge \sum_{x\in A} \binom{d(x)}{t} \\
				 &\ge m \binom{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{x\in A} d(x)}{t} \\
				 &= m \binom{e(G)/m}{t}.
			\end{align*}
			Let $d = e(G)/m$, the average degree of the vertices in $A$. Simplifying the above expression,
			\[ \frac{s-1}{m} \ge \frac{d(d-1)\cdots (d-t+1)}{n(n-1)\cdots(n-t+1)} \ge \left(\frac{d-t+1}{n-t+1}\right)^t, \]
			where the second inequality follows from the fact that $d \le n$. Therefore,
			\[ e(G) \le m \left( \left(\frac{s-1}{m}\right)^{1/t} (n-t+1) + (t-1) \right) = (s-1)^{1/t} (n-t+1) m^{1 - 1/t} + (t-1)m, \]
			completing the proof.
		\end{proof}

		What are some consequences of the above bound?
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item We get a bound on $\exx(n;K_{s,t})$. We claim that for $n\in\N$ and $s,t\ge 2$,
			\[ \exx(n;K_{s,t}) \le \frac{1}{2} z(n,n;s,t). \]
			Indeed, if $G_n = (V,E)$ has no $K_{s,t}$, make a bipartite graph $G'$ that has vertex set $V \times \{0,1\}$ such that $uv$ is an edge in $G$ iff $\{(u,0),(v,1)\}$ is an edge in $G'$.\\
			$G'$ satisfies the Zarankiewicz condition. If there do exist $S \subseteq V\times\{0\}$ and $T' \subseteq V \times \{1\}$ such that all $S$-$T$ edges are in $G$, then $\pi_1(S) \cap \pi_1(T') = \emptyset$ (otherwise, a vertex would be adjacent to itself in $G$, which is clearly false). This implies that $K_{s,t} \subseteq G$, which is a contradiction.\\
			Since $e(G') = 2e(G)$, the claim follows.

			\item When $s=t=2$, we get
			\[ z(m,n;2,2) \le (n-1)m^{1/2} + m \text{ and } z(n,n;2,2) \le (n-1)n^{1/2} + n. \]
			Therefore,
			\[ \exx(n;K_{2,2}) \le \frac{1}{2} (n + (n-1)\sqrt{n}). \]
			Note that $K_{2,2}\simeq C_4$. Therefore, a square-free graph on $n$ vertices has $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2})$ edges.\\

			In fact, this bound is tight! We give an algebraic construction of a suitable graph with no $K_{2,2}$, known as the \emph{Levi graph for the projective plane}.\\
			Let $p$ be prime and consider the $3$-dimensional vector space $\mathcal{V} = \mathbb{F}_p^3$ (over $\mathbb{F}_p$). Let $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ be the set of all $1$- and $2$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathcal{V}$ respectively.\\
			Define the graph $G = ( \mathcal{P} \sqcup \mathcal{L} , E )$ as follows. For $x \in \mathcal{P}$ and $L \in \mathcal{L}$, let $x$ be adjacent to $L$ in $G$ iff $x \subseteq L$.\\
			We claim that $G$ has no $K_{2,2}$. Suppose otherwise and let $x_1,x_2\in\mathcal{P}$ and $L_1,L_2\in\mathcal{L}$ such that the $x_i$ are adjacent to the $L_j$. If $x_1 = \langle u \rangle$ and $x_2 = \langle v \rangle$, then $u$ and $v$ are linearly independent, which implies that $L_i = \langle u,v\rangle$. This contradicts the fact that the $L_i$ are distinct!\\
			What are the cardinalities of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{L}$?
			\begin{itemize}
				\item To get a $1$-dimensional subspace, we pick a non-zero $u$ and consider $\langle u\rangle$. In $\mathcal{V}$, there are $p^3 - 1$ non-zero $u$. We must now divide by $p-1$ to account for the fact that linearly dependent vectors generate the same $1$-dimensional subspace. Any non-zero $u$ has precisely $p-1$ non-zero multiples. Therefore,
				\[ |\mathcal{P}| = \frac{p^3 - 1}{p - 1} = p^2 + p + 1. \]

				\item Any two-dimensional subspace can be uniquely chosen by considering the complementary $1$-dimensional subspace. As a result,
				\[ |\mathcal{L}| = |\mathcal{P}| = p^2 + p + 1. \]
			\end{itemize}
			How many edges does $G$ have?\\
			Fix $x = \langle u \rangle \in \mathcal{P}$. We wish to determine how many $L\in\mathcal{L}$ are adjacent to $x$ in $G$. Such an $L$ can be created by choosing $v \not\in x$ and letting $L = \langle u,v\rangle$.\\The number of choices of $v$ is $p^3 - p$, but each such subspace is repeated for $p^2-p$ choices of $v$ since the cardinality of $\langle u,v\rangle$ is $p^2$. Therefore,
			\[ d(x) = \frac{p^3 - p}{p^2 - p} = p + 1. \]
			The total number of edges is
			\[ |\mathcal{P}| (p + 1) = (p+1)(p^2+p+1) = p^3 + 2p^2 + 2p + 1, \]
			which is $\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{P}|^{3/2})$!
			Therefore, our $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2})$ bound is tight. It in fact turns out that the Levi graph is the ``best possible'' in some sense.
		\end{enumerate}
