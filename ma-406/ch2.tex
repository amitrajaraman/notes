\subsection{Basis for a Topology}

\begin{exercise}
	Let $X$ be a topological space and $A\subseteq X$. Suppose that for each $x\in A$, there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U\subseteq A$. Show that $A$ is open in $X$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution*}
	For each $x\in A$, denote by $U_x$ an open subset of $A$ that contains $A$. Then $A = \bigcup_{x\in A} U_x$. However, an arbitrary union of open sets is open and thus, so is $A$.
\end{solution*}

\setcounter{exercise}{4}
\begin{exercise}
	Show that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ equals the intersection of all topologies that contain $\mathcal{A}$. Prove the same if $\mathcal{A}$ is a subbasis.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution*}
	Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the topology generated by $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ be a topology that contains $\mathcal{A}$. Let $U\in\mathcal{T}$. Then $U=\bigcup_{i\in I} B_i$ for some $(B_i)_{i\in I}$ in $\mathcal{A}$. However, each $B_i$ is also in $\mathcal{T}'$. Since an arbitrary union of open sets is open, $U\in\mathcal{T'}$ as well. Therefore, $\mathcal{T}\subseteq\mathcal{T}'$, proving the result. The solution for the case where $\mathcal{A}$ is a subbasis is very similar and so omitted.
\end{solution*}

\begin{exercise}
	Show that the collection
	\[ \mathcal{B} = \{(a,b) : a<b, a\text{ and }b\text{ are rational}\}. \]
\end{exercise}

\subsection{The Subspace Topology}

\begin{exercise}
	Show that if $Y$ is a subspace of $X$ and $A$ is a subset of $Y$, then the topology $A$ inherits as a subspace of $Y$ is the same as the topology it inherits as a subspace of $X$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution*}	
	The topology $A$ inherits as a subspace of $X$ is
	\begin{align*}
		\mathcal{T} &= \{ U\cap A : U\text{ open in }X \} \\
			&= \{ (U\cap Y) \cap A : U\text{ open in }X \} \\
			&= \{ V\cap A : V\text{ open in }Y \},
	\end{align*}
	which is the topology it inherits as a subspace of $Y$.
\end{solution*}

\begin{exercise}
	If $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ are topologies on $X$ and $\mathcal{T}'$ is strictly finer than $\mathcal{T}$, what can you say about the corresponding subspace topologies on the subset $Y$ of $X$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution*}
	It is easily seen that $\mathcal{T}'_Y$ is finer than $\mathcal{T}_Y$. We further see that it need not be strictly finer by considering the example $X=\{a,b,c\}$, $Y=\{a,b\}$, $\mathcal{T}=\{\emptyset,X,\{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\}\}$, and $\mathcal{T}'$ as the discrete topology on $X$.
\end{solution*}
