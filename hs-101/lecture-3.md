_Microeconomics_ focuses on the individual parts of the economy, how households/firms make decisions and interact in specific markets, whereas _macroeconomics_ looks at the economy as a whole, looking at economy-wide phenomena such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.

_Positive statements_, also known as _descriptive analysis_, attempt to describe the world as it is, whereas _normative statements_, also known as _prescriptive analysis_, are statements about how the world should be.    
Economists may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories. They may also have different values and thus have different normative views.

A _competitive market_ is a market where are there are many buyers and sellers so that each has a negligible impact on the market price.    
In a perfect competitive market, all products are the same, numerous buyers/sellers have no influence over the price.    
A _monopoly_ is on the other end of the spectrum.    
_Oligopoly_ means not many sellers and not very aggressive competition. Example. Telecom market.      
_Monopolistic competition_ (monopoly+competition) has many sellers and slightly differentiated products. Each seller may set price for its own product. Example. Hotel market.

The _law of demand_ states that, other things equal, the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises.    
The law of demand doesn't always hold. Example. Stock market. The usual rule of thumb is to buy more when the price of the stocks increases. Another example is paintings/antiques in auctions.
