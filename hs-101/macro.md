# Lecture 18

In contrast to microeconomics, macroeconomics studies economy-wide phenomena such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. It attempts to explain how economic changes affect households, firms, and markets simultaneously.

How do we measure the performance of an economy? Two measures that come to mind are per capita income and life expectancy.    
More often though, to measure the performance of an economy, we use the _Gross Domestic Product_ (GDP). It measures two things -- the total income of everyone in the country and the total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services. This is because both of these quantities are equal -- an economy's income is the same as its expenditure. This is made clear by the circular flow diagram we studied earlier.

The main actors in any economy are consumers, workers, and employers. Each person is a consumer and furthermore, they may be a worker or an employer.    
In addition to the $$7$$ principles we studied at the beginning of microeconomics, there are $$3$$ that are relevant to macroeconomics.

_Macroeconomics_ is the analysis of the backdrop of economic conditions against which firms/consumers make decisions.    
The measures we use are _per capita income_ and _life expectancy_. It is seen that both of them vary very widely across countries. We also sometimes use the total market value of a nation's production - its _Gross Domestic Product (GDP)_.

What makes countries that contribute more to the global economy different?

8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.     
_Productivity_ is the amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker's time.

9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.    
_Inflation_ is an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy. In the long run, the growth in quantity of money causes inflation. The value of the money falls.

10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.    
We shall study this in the _Phillips curve_.

# Lecture 19

Here, we mention some major events since the start of the millennium:

* The dotcom bubble which peaked on March 10, 2000. NASDAQ reached 5123.5 points and quickly lost about three-quarters of its value.
* 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the ensuing war on Afghanistan.
* US invasion of Iraq (launched on March 20, 2003).
* 2007/8 global financial crises - began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. This is also known as the _subprime crisis_.
<!-- say maggi guy maintains a ledger of how much people owe him. he gets a loan putting that as collateral. when he tries to pay it back however, realizes that people have left the campus so he cannot afford to pay back the loan. this chain of events triggers all the related people to default, spreading and resulting in debts accumulating. NPA is non-performing asset -->
* The euro crises (in October 2009) when Greece revealed a "black hole" in its budget, that is, deficits larger than previously known.
* Outbreak of Syrian Civil War on January 26, 2011, which began with peaceful protests in Damascus.
* Outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in December 2013, when a 2 year old boy died in Guinea.
* 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea.
* Massive flow of regugees from Syria, Iraq, and Eritrea towards Europe in Summer 2015 (60 million in 2014 alone). This is the highest ever recorded to leave their home country.
* Chinese stock market plunges 30% in June/July 2014 after rising 75% since the previous October.
* The price of oil fell sharply in 2015/16 falling below $30 per barrel before recovering slightly. This mainly affected Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.
* Human wave of migrants from Syria, Libya, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and others to the safe havens of Europe, which caused a crisis.
* On June 23, 2016, Brexit happened and Britain voted (narrowly) to leave the European Union. The migrants to Britain were a contributing factor.
* On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump won the elections with promises having an impact on globalization.
* On September 3, 2017, North Korea conducted its 6th nuclear tests. There was a "war of words" between Trump and Kim Jong-un.
* Trump's China-related trade tariffs caused a trade war.
* For India, bank recapitalization and GST (a unified task structure) were major. Liberalization made our borders porous, opening us to the global economy.

<!-- NPA ratios (large in ppublic sector banks)
if banks merge, become more efficient? based on capital adequacy ratio
if the money in the bank goes out and doesn't come back, then :(
why do some countries experience rapid income growth?
why do some countries have high rates of inflation -->
What is the difference between Ghana, India, and South Korea? The difference between the first two is due to the physical and human capital, whereas that between the latter two is attributed to knowledge.

Macroeconomic events arise from the interaction of many people trying to maximize their own welfare - firms, consumers, the government, forex dealers, FII, MNCs, RBI, etc.

# Lecture 20

GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.

* We use market prices to measure the amount people are paying for different goods.
* GDP attempts to include all goods and services. If someone is renting out a house, then the tenant's expenditure/landlord's income will be counted. But even if someone owns the house they are staying in, we try to include it in the GDP by estimating its rental value. Some products, such as vegetables grown and consumed at home, illegally sold drugs, etc that never enter the market place, are difficult to include in the GDP however.
* GDP includes both tangible goods (food, clothing) and intangible services (haircuts, housecleaning).
* GDP includes goods and services currently produced, we do not include transactions involving items produced in the past.
* GDP measures the production within the geographical confines of a country. If an Indian citizen works temporarily in Canada, then their production is considered in Canada's GDP. If a Canadian citizen owns a factory in India, then the production of the factory is part of India's GDP.
* The GDP measures the value of production within a specific interval, usually a quarter (three months) or a year.

We can measure GDP using either an income method or an expenditure method.

_Intermediate goods_ are goods used up entirely in the production of final goods.    
The _value added_ is the dollar value of an industry's sales minus the value of the intermediate goods used in production.

There are several transactions that have nothing to do with final goods. As a result, we exclude things like stocks/bonds (securities), social security, unemployment compensation (government transfer payments), individual gifts, corporate gifts (private transfer payments) etc. We also exclude the transfer of second-hand goods (we have already made the purchase and it has been included in the value), household production, and legal/illegal underground transactions.    
That is, we only want to count the sales of final goods that occur through the market.

Therefore, we measure the GDP as the sum of the
* national income:
	* compensation of employees
	* proprietor's income
	* corporate profits
	* net interest
	* rental income
* depreciation
* indirect taxes minus subsidies
* net factor payments to the rest of the world

In the expenditure approach,
* the consumption expenditure comprises
	* durable consumer goods (life span more than three years)
	* non-durable consumer goods (life span at most three years)
	* services (mental or physical help)
* gross private domestic investment
	* the creation of capital goods such as factories/machines that can yield production (and thus consumption). This also includes changes in business inventories and repairs made to machines and buildings.


# Lecture 21

The GDP can be looked at as either the total expenditure on domestically produced final goods/services or the total income earned by domestically located factors of production.    
Expenditure and income are equal because any money spent by the buyer becomes income to the seller.

The expenditure components of GDP are consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.    
Investment includes business fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and inventory investment. Investment is basically spending on new capital.

A _stock_ is a quantity measured at a point of time. A _flow_ is a quantity measured per unit time. For example, GDP is a flow measure.    
The government spending excludes transfer payments (like say unemployment insurance payments) because they are not spending on goods and services. Therefore, we have

$$\text{Y} = \text{C} + \text{I} + \text{G} + \text{NX},$$

where $$C$$ is the consumption, $$I$$ is the investment, $$G$$ is the government spending, and $$NX$$ is the net export. The left is the GDP, which is the value of total output, and the right is the aggregate expenditure.

Price is a common unit using which we can measure other expenditures. We must fix the base year if we want to compare production. We then only compare a different year's production by taking the prices as the base year's prices.

A firm's _value added_ is the value of its output minus the value of the intermediate goods used to produce that output. GDP can also be seen as the net value added across firms.

# Lecture 22

* Treatment of inventories - This depends on whether the goods are sold or if they spoil. If the goods are sold, then their value is included in the GDP. If they spoil, the GDP remains unchanged.

# Lecture 23

Thus, we get the real GDP by considering a particular cost for the items.

We must take inflation into account when calculating the GDP. Further, it becomes difficult to compare different countries since the degree of inflation is different in different countries.

We tend to overestimate the rate of inflation and underestimate the rate of real economic growth when we consider the fact that earlier, people did not have modern conveniences.

As a result, to compensate for the shift in base year prices. We chain weight to average the prices.

Nominal GDP measures the current rupee value and real GDP measures output valued at constant prices. The _GDP deflator_, called the _implicit price deflator_, is equal to the ratio of the two, and measures the price of output relative to its price in the base year. It reflects what is happening to the level of prices in the economy.

The (real and nominal) per capita GDPs are of interest as well. Per capita growth should be looked at as well.

To resolve the problems in comparing GDP, we look at _purchasing power parity_. How much does a particular product cost in dollars in different countries? For example, a Starbucks grande latte costs $9.83 in Oslo but $2.80 in New Delhi.

# Lecture 24

The GDP is the output produced within some geographic location. The GNI/GNP (Gross National Income/Product) is the output produced by the citizens of a geographic region. This value must be remitted back to the country. 

$$\text{GNP} = \text{GDP} + \text{Factor payments from abroad} - \text{Factor payments to abroad}$$

The _Net Domestic Product_ is equal to $$\text{GDP}-\text{Depreciation}$$ and the _Net National Product_ is equal to $$\text{GNP}-\text{Depreciation}$$. Depreciation is called "consumption of fixed capital". It is the cost of producing the output of the economy.

# Lecture 25

How do we measure cost of living?

We usually use the _Wholesale Price Index_ (WPI) to measure the level of prices or inflation. It consolidates the prices of several goods and services into a single index that measures the overall level of prices. To do this reliably, some options are:
* Compute the average of all prices. This treats all goods and services equally, which need not be the case.
* Take a the ratio of weighted averages of the prices while also considering a certain base year. For example, if we buy $$5$$ apples and $$2$$ oranges and take the base year as $$2011$$, we can calculate

$$\text{WPI} = \frac{5\times\text{current price of apples} + 2\times\text{current price of oranges}}{5\times\text{2011 price of apples} + 2\times\text{2011 price of oranges}}$$

The WPI is used to provide estimates of inflation at the wholesale transaction level for the economy as a whole. This allows the government to check for inflation, in essential commodities in particular. It is used as a deflator for many sectors of the economy, including estimating GDP. It is also used for indexation in business contracts. Global investors track the WPI as a key macro indicator for their investment decisions.

CPI

_Producer Price Index_ (PPI) measures the price of a typical basket of goods bought by firms, not consumers.

# Lecture 26

The _HSBC Purchasing Manager Index_ (PMI) measures the factory production based on the monthly responses of purchasing executives in around 500 manufacturing companies. A value over 50 means expansion and a value under 50 means contraction.

The GDP deflator measures the prices of all goods produced, whereas the WPI measures only ht prices of goods/services bought by consumers. In particular, an increase in the price of goods bought by firms/government shows up in the former but not the latter. Also, imported goods are not part of the GDP and do not show up in the GDP deflator. Lastly, the WPI assigns fixed weights to the prices of different goods whereas the GDP deflator assigns changing weights.

We use two indices in general, the _Laspeyres index_ (which works with a fixed basket of goods) and the _Paasche index_ (which works with a changing basket of goods)

The Laspeyres price index is equal to

$$P = \frac{\sum p_t q_0}{\sum p_0 q_0} \times 100 $$

and the Paasche price index is equal to

$$P = \frac{\sum p_t q_0}{\sum p_0 q_t} \times 100, $$
where $$P$$ is the price index, $$p_t$$ is the current price, $$q_t$$ is the quantity used in the current period, $$p_0$$ is the price of the base period, and $$q_0$$ is the quantity used in the base period.

Laspeyres requires quantity data from only the base period, which allows a more meaningful comparison, but may overweight goods whose prices increase and does not reflect changes in buying patterns over time.    
Paasche reflects current buying habits because it uses current quantities, but it requires quantity data from the current year. It is difficult to attribute changes in the index to price changes alone and tends to overweight goods whose prices have declined. The prices need to be recomputed each year.

The Fischer index is equal to the geometric mean of these two indices.

_Unemployment rate_ is the statistic that measures the percentage of people who want to work but do not have jobs, reflecting the performance of the economy.

_Labor force_ is the sum of the employed and unemployed, and the _unemployment rate_ is the perecentage of the labor force that is unemployed.    
The average rate of unemployment around which the economy fluctuates is called the _natural rate of unemployment_. It is the rate of unemployment towards which the economy gravitates.

# Lecture 27

We have $$L = E + U$$, where $$L$$ is the labor force, $$E$$ is the number of employed workers, and $$U$$ is the number of unemployed workers.    
The rate of unemployment is $$U/L$$. The rate of job separation (severance rate) is denoted $$s$$ and the rate of job finding as $$f$$.    
Then, the number of people finding jobs is $$fU$$ and the number of people losing jobs is $$sE$$. In steady state, $$fU = sE$$. Equivalently,

$$U/L = s/(s+f).$$

Any policy aimed at lowering the natural rate of unemployment should either reduce the rate of job separation $$s$$ or increase the rate of job finding $$f$$.    
The two main reasons for unemployment are _job search_ and _wage rigidity_.

_Efficiency-wage_ theories propose another cause of wage rigidity. They claim that high wages make workers more productive. There are three theories related to this:

* An increase in wage allows workers to get a more nutritious diet, which increases productivity.
* Higher wage increases the workers' incentive to stay with the firm, which decreases hiring/training costs.
* The average quality of a firm's workforce depends on the wage it pays to its employees. If a firm decreases its wage, the best employees may take jobs elsewhere, leaving the firm with inferior employees - this is called the _adverse selection problem_.

The unemployment caused by the time it takes workers to search for a job is called _frictional unemployment_, Economists call a change in the composition of demand among industries or regions a _sectoral shift_.    
Since sectoral shifts are always occurring, there is always frictional unemployment. In an attempt to reduce frictional unemployment, some policies inadvertently increase it instead. An example of this is _unemployment insurance_.

Wage rigidty is the failure of wages to adjust until labour supply eqals the labour demand.
