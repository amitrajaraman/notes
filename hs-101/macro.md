# Lecture 18

In contrast to microeconomics, macroeconomics studies economy-wide phenomena such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. It attempts to explain how economic changes affect households, firms, and markets simultaneously.

How do we measure the performance of an economy? Two measures that come to mind are per capita income and life expectancy.    

The main actors in any economy are consumers, workers, and employers. Each person is a consumer and furthermore, they may be a worker or an employer.    
In addition to the 7 principles we studied at the beginning of microeconomics, there are 3 that are relevant to macroeconomics.

_Macroeconomics_ is the analysis of the backdrop of economic conditions against which firms/consumers make decisions.    
The measures we use are _per capita income_ and _life expectancy_. It is seen that both of them vary very widely across countries. We also sometimes use the total market value of a nation's production - its _Gross Domestic Product (GDP)_.

What makes countries that contribute more to the global economy different?

8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.     
_Productivity_ is the amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker's time.

9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money.    
_Inflation_ is an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy. In the long run, the growth in quantity of money causes inflation. The value of the money falls.

10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.    
We shall study this in the _Phillips curve_.

# Lecture 19

Here, we mention some major events since the start of the millennium:

* The dotcom bubble which peaked on March 10, 2000. NASDAQ reached 5123.5 points and quickly lost about three-quarters of its value.
* 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the ensuing war on Afghanistan.
* US invasion of Iraq (launched on March 20, 2003).
* 2007/8 global financial crises - began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. This is also known as the _subprime crisis_.
<!-- say maggi guy maintains a ledger of how much people owe him. he gets a loan putting that as collateral. when he tries to pay it back however, realizes that people have left the campus so he cannot afford to pay back the loan. this chain of events triggers all the related people to default, spreading and resulting in debts accumulating. NPA is non-performing asset -->
* The euro crises (in October 2009) when Greece revealed a "black hole" in its budget, that is, deficits larger than previously known.
* Outbreak of Syrian Civil War on January 26, 2011, which began with peaceful protests in Damascus.
* Outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in December 2013, when a 2 year old boy died in Guinea.
* 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea.
* Massive flow of regugees from Syria, Iraq, and Eritrea towards Europe in Summer 2015 (60 million in 2014 alone). This is the highest ever recorded to leave their home country.
* Chinese stock market plunges 30% in June/July 2014 after rising 75% since the previous October.
* The price of oil fell sharply in 2015/16 falling below $30 per barrel before recovering slightly. This mainly affected Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia.
* Human wave of migrants from Syria, Libya, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and others to the safe havens of Europe, which caused a crisis.
* On June 23, 2016, Brexit happened and Britain voted (narrowly) to leave the European Union. The migrants to Britain were a contributing factor.
* On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump won the elections with promises having an impact on globalization.
* On September 3, 2017, North Korea conducted its 6th nuclear tests. There was a "war of words" between Trump and Kim Jong-un.
* Trump's China-related trade tariffs caused a trade war.
* For India, bank recapitalization and GST (a unified task structure) were major. Liberalization made our borders porous, opening us to the global economy.

Macroeconomic events arise from the interaction of many people trying to maximize their own welfare - firms, consumers, the government, forex dealers, FII, MNCs, RBI, etc.

# Lecture 20

More often though, to measure the performance of an economy, we use the _Gross Domestic Product_ (GDP). It measures two things -- the total income of everyone in the country and the total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services. This is because both of these quantities are equal -- an economy's income is the same as its expenditure. This is made clear by the circular flow diagram we studied earlier.    

GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.

* We use market prices to measure the amount people are paying for different goods.
* GDP attempts to include all goods and services. If someone is renting out a house, then the tenant's expenditure/landlord's income will be counted. But even if someone owns the house they are staying in, we try to include it in the GDP by estimating its rental value. Some products, such as vegetables grown and consumed at home, illegally sold drugs, etc that never enter the market place, are difficult to include in the GDP however.
* GDP includes both tangible goods (food, clothing) and intangible services (haircuts, housecleaning).
* GDP includes goods and services currently produced, we do not include transactions involving items produced in the past.
* GDP measures the production within the geographical confines of a country. If an Indian citizen works temporarily in Canada, then their production is considered in Canada's GDP. If a Canadian citizen owns a factory in India, then the production of the factory is part of India's GDP.
* The GDP measures the value of production within a specific interval, usually a quarter (three months) or a year.

_Intermediate goods_ are goods used up entirely in the production of final goods.    
_Value added_ is the dollar value of an industry's sales minus the value of the intermediate goods used in production.

The difference between the GDP calculated using the income and expenditure methods is called _statistical discrepancy_ (it arises due to imperfect data sources).

There are several transactions that have nothing to do with final goods. As a result, we exclude things like stocks/bonds (securities), social security, unemployment compensation (government transfer payments), individual gifts, corporate gifts (private transfer payments) etc. We also exclude the transfer of second-hand goods (we have already made the purchase and it has been included in the value), household production, and legal/illegal underground transactions.    
That is, we only want to count the sales of final goods that occur through the market.

Therefore, we measure the GDP as the sum of the
* national income:
	* compensation of employees
	* proprietor's income
	* corporate profits
	* net interest
	* rental income
* depreciation
* indirect taxes minus subsidies
* net factor payments to the rest of the world

Gross private domestic investment consists of
* the creation of capital goods such as factories/machines that can yield production (and thus consumption). This also includes changes in business inventories and repairs made to machines and buildings.
* producer durables or capital goods (life span more than three years)
* fixed investments (purchases by a business of newly produced producer durables or capital goods)
* inventory investments (changes in stocks of finished goods and goods in process, as well as changes in raw materials)

# Lecture 21

The GDP can be looked at as either the total expenditure on domestically produced final goods/services or the total income earned by domestically located factors of production.    
We can calculate the GDP in three different ways: output (the sum of value added in each sector), income, and expenditure.    
The expenditure components of GDP are consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.
* _Consumption_ $$\text{C}$$ is the value of all goods and services purchased by households. It comprises of
	* durable consumer goods (life span more than three years)
	* non-durable consumer goods (life span at most three years)
	* services (mental or physical help)
	It does not include purchase of new housing. We can choose to include education in this or in the next section.    
* _Investment_ $$\text{I}$$ includes
	* business fixed investment (spending on plant and equipment that firms will use to produce the other goods/services),
	* residential fixed investment (spending on housing units/structures by consumers and landlords), and
	* inventory investment (the change in the value of all firms' inventories).
	The purchase of new housing is the one houshold expense that is categorized as investment instead of consumption.
	Investment is basically spending on new capital. This investment is not the same as the usual financial usage of the word.
* _Government purchases_ $$\text{G}$$ includes all government spending on goods and services. It includes salaries of government workers and spending on public works. It excludes transfer payments (like unemployment insurance payments) because they are not in exchange for currently produced goods and services. Transfer payments can be thought of as negative taxes.
* _Net exports_ $$\text{NX}$$ is equal to $$\text{EX}-\text{IM}$$, where $$\text{EX}$$ is the value of total exports (foreign purchases of domestic goods) and $$\text{IM}$$ is the value of total imports (domestic purchases of foreign goods).

An important identity is:

$$\text{Y} = \text{C} + \text{I} + \text{G} + \text{NX},$$

where $$\text{Y}$$ is the value of total output (GDP). The expression on the right is the total expenditure.

A _stock_ is a quantity measured at a point of time. For example, a person's wealth and the government's debt are stocks.     
A _flow_ is a quantity measured per unit time. For example, a person's annual savings and GDP are flow measures.    

Price is the common unit using which we can measure other expenditures.

GDP is essentially an aggregate of price$$\times$$quantity.    
The _nominal GDP_ is the result when we use the price and quantity belonging to the same year.     
The _real GDP_ is the result when we fix a certain base year and use the price of that base year (we use the quantity of the year we are calculating the GDP of).     
Since real GDP is not affected by changes in prices, it reflects the economy's production of goods and services.

<!-- A firm's _value added_ is the value of its output minus the value of the intermediate goods used to produce that output. -->
GDP can also be seen as the net value added across firms -- we do not count the final goods because that would be double counting. This is the calculating of GDP using the output method that we mentioned earlier.

# Lecture 22

Some more rules for computing GDP are:

* To compute the total value of goods/services, the national income uses market prices.
* As mentioned earlier, used goods are not used in the calculation of GDP.
* How do we treat inventories? This depends on whether the goods are sold or if they spoil. If the goods are sold, then their value is included in the GDP. If they spoil, the GDP remains unchanged.
* Some goods are not sold in the market. So, we use their imputed prices instead (recall the example of a house someone owns and lives in).
* Intermediate goods are not counted in the GDP, only the final goods are.

Now, the calculation of real GDP fixes a certain base year. This is not good because prices may change drastically over periods of time and it is misleading to use the values from 10-15 years ago. Therefore, we shift the base year prices once in a while (every 5-10 years).

# Lecture 23

We tend to overestimate the rate of inflation and underestimate the rate of real economic growth when we consider the fact that earlier, people did not have modern conveniences.    
As a result, to compensate for the shift in base year prices. We chain weight to average the prices.

The _GDP deflator_ or _implicit price deflator_ is the ratio of the nominal GDP to the real GDP. It gives a measure of the price of output relative to its price in the base year. It reflects the level of prices in the economy (and not quantities).    
Observe that the GDP deflator is equal to $$1$$ in the base year.    
    
_Inflation_ is used to describe a situation where the economy's price level is increasing. The _inflation rate_ is the percentage change from one period to the next. It can be calculated as the percentage change of the GDP deflator.    

We must take inflation into account when calculating the GDP. Further, it becomes difficult to compare different countries since the degree of inflation is different in different countries.

Some problems in comparing GDPs are:
* GDP is understated due to the informal sector.
* Household scale economies are not taken into account.
* Exchange rates to convert the GNP in local currency to USD is based on relative prices of internationally traded goods.
* In developing countries, many cheap, labour-intensive, unstandardized goods and services have no impact on the exchange rate as they are not traded.
* The price of foreign exchange is less than the equilibrium/market clearing price due to import barriers, restrictions on access to foreign currency, export subsidies, or state trading.
* Resistant services such as healthcare and government administration which comprise more than 10% of most countries' expenditures distort cross-national comparisons.

The (real and nominal) per capita GDPs are of interest and per capita growth should be looked at as well.

To resolve the problems in comparing GDP, we look at _purchasing power parity_. How much does a particular product cost in dollars in different countries? For example, a Starbucks grande latte costs $9.83 in Oslo but $2.80 in New Delhi.    
We want a dollar to have the same purchasing power in any country.

# Lecture 24

The GDP is the output produced within some geographic location. The GNI/GNP (_Gross National Income/Product_) is the output produced by the citizens of a geographic region. This value must be remitted back to the country. It is the total income earned by permanent residents of the country (nationals). 

$$\text{GNP} = \text{GDP} + \text{Factor payments from abroad} - \text{Factor payments to abroad}$$

The _Net Domestic Product_ (NDP) is equal to $$\text{GDP}-\text{Depreciation}$$ and the _Net National Product_ (NNP) is equal to $$\text{GNP}-\text{Depreciation}$$.    
Depreciation is called "consumption of fixed capital". It is the cost of producing the output of the economy.

In calculating India's GDP, there are three categories:
* Category A: The annual figures of commodity-wise output and prices and values of different types of input or input-output proportions are known.
	We aggregate the commodity-wise price-output multiplications to get the gross value of output and then deduct the total value of input.    
	This consists of agriculture, registered manufacturing, construction, forestry and logging, mining and quarrying, and fishing.
* Category B: The actual figures of all types of factor earnings reported in the annual accounts of difference companies or undertakings are published on a regular basis and known.
	We aggregate the actual figures of employee compensation, interest, rent, and operating surplus or profits relating to each organization.    
	This consists of public administration and defence, railways, water transport, banking and insurance, communication, electricity, air transport, and real estate.
* Category C: The estimates of working force derived from the decennial population census data and the estimates of average productivity of labour derived from data is shown by periodic sample surveys.
	We interpolate/extrapolate the decennial data and periodic estimates of average productivity are carried forward/backward by certain indicators. We then derive the year-to-year estimates of workers and their average productivity, and multiply to arrive at the estimate of value added.    
	This consists of trade, hotels, and restaurants, unregistered manufacturing, ownership of dwellings, unorganized road and water transport, gas and water supply, storage, and other services.

# Lecture 25

Inflation measures the general increase in level of prices. How do we measure cost of living/inflation?

We usually use the _Wholesale Price Index_ (WPI) or _Consumer Price Index_ (CPI) to measure the level of prices or inflation. It consolidates the prices of several goods and services into a single index that measures the overall level of prices. To do this reliably, some options are:
* Compute the average of all prices. This treats all goods and services equally, which need not be the case. For example, food should have a higher weightage than clothing.
* Take a the ratio of weighted averages of the prices while also considering a certain base year. For example, if we buy $$5$$ apples and $$2$$ oranges and take the base year as $$2011$$, we can calculate

$$\text{WPI} = \frac{5\times\text{current price of apples} + 2\times\text{current price of oranges}}{5\times\text{2011 price of apples} + 2\times\text{2011 price of oranges}}$$

On top of this, we assign a weight to each sector, taking into account its share in the market.    
The CPI can be calculated as:
1. Fix the basket and determine which prices are important to the average consumer.
2. Find the prices of each of the goods in the basket at each point in time.
3. Compute the basket's cost.
4. Choose a base year and compute the cost. Compute the index as the ratio of the basket costs between the two times.
<!-- 5. Compute the inflation rate as the percentage change in the CPI. -->

The inflation rate can be measured as the percentage change of CPI or WPI.

The WPI is used to provide estimates of inflation at the wholesale transaction level for the economy as a whole. This allows the government to check for inflation, in essential commodities in particular. It is used as a deflator for many sectors of the economy, including estimating GDP. It is also used for indexation in business contracts. Global investors track the WPI as a key macro indicator for their investment decisions.

We assign less weight to food items that are more volatile over time. As a result, core manufactured products have high weightage. According to purists, core inflation using only manufactured products carries significance as a more accurate predictor in the long term. This weeds out transitory components such as food and energy. Some alternate methods are the trimmed-mean method, which strips the most volatile items off the index each month.

In any index,
* What base year do we choose? The year should be somewhat normal/stable with respect to economic activities and their prices. We should have reliable data and the year should be as recent as possible. The base year for closely related economic indicators should not be wildly different.
* What choice of sample commodity do we choose? We should sample over different varieties of each commodity. Including all these varieties in the index is neither desirable nor feasible. We choose one or two popular varieties consumed by the index population. This popularity is based on family budget data, market intelligence, etc.
* Which price do we choose? We should choose that price which is charged to the consumer, including excise duty, sales tax, etc and excluding rebates.

In the field, price supervisors check the veracity of prices quoted by the price collectors by making spot visits. We further scrutinize in case
* the variation is more than 10% for a non-seasonal item.
* the variation is more than 50% for a seasonal item.
* the variation is more than 3 points in the item level index wrt the previous month.

_Producer Price Index_ (PPI) measures the price of a typical basket of goods bought by firms, not consumers.

# Lecture 26

The _HSBC Purchasing Manager Index_ (PMI) measures the factory production based on the monthly responses of purchasing executives in around 500 manufacturing companies. A value over 50 means expansion and a value under 50 means contraction.

Now, should we use the WPI or the GDP deflator?    
The GDP deflator measures the prices of all goods produced, whereas the WPI measures only the prices of goods/services bought by consumers. In particular, an increase in the price of goods bought by firms/government shows up in the former but not the latter. Also, imported goods are not part of the GDP and do not show up in the GDP deflator. Lastly, the WPI assigns fixed weights to the prices of different goods whereas the GDP deflator assigns changing weights (a fixed basket of goods v. a changing basket of goods).

We use two indices in general, the _Laspeyres index_ (which works with a fixed basket of goods) and the _Paasche index_ (which works with a changing basket of goods).     
The Laspeyres price index is equal to

$$P = \frac{\sum p_t q_0}{\sum p_0 q_0} \times 100 $$

and the Paasche price index is equal to

$$P = \frac{\sum p_t q_t}{\sum p_0 q_t} \times 100, $$

where $$P$$ is the price index, $$p_t$$ is the current price, $$q_t$$ is the quantity used in the current period, $$p_0$$ is the price of the base period, and $$q_0$$ is the quantity used in the base period.

Laspeyres requires quantity data from only the base period, which allows a more meaningful comparison because changes in the index can be attributed to changes in price, but may overweight goods whose prices increase and does not reflect changes in buying patterns over time.    
Paasche reflects current buying habits because it uses current quantities, but it requires quantity data from the current year, which may be difficult to obtain. It is difficult to attribute changes in the index to price changes alone and tends to overweight goods whose prices have declined. The prices need to be recomputed each year.    
_Fischer's ideal index_ is equal to the geometric mean of these two indices.

When the prices of different goods are changing differently, the Laspeyres index tends to overstate the increase in cost of living. This is because it does not take into account that consumers can replace more expensive items with less expensive items.    
Conversely, the Paasche index tends to understate the increase in cost of living. While it takes the substitution effect into account, but does not take into account the decrease in the consumers' welfare resulting from this substitution (because we take a fixed basket of goods). This issue is known as _substitution bias_.

As new goods are introduced, consumers have more choice so the dollar is worth more.    
Some quality change may be unmeasured. If the quality of a good deteriorates while its price remains the same, the value of a dollar is dropping.

Therefore, it is difficult to compare WPI (Paasche) and the GDP deflator (Laspeyres), since they are both bad in their own ways. They follow similar trends.

We can compare today's prices with that of a different year's as

$$\text{Amount in today's dollars} = \text{Amount in other year's dollars} \times \frac{\text{Price level today}}{\text{Price level in other year}}.$$

When we perform the above correction, we are said to _index_ the amount for inflation. Approximately, when we put our money in a bank, the real interest rate is equal to the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.

_Unemployment rate_ is the statistic that measures the percentage of people who want to work but do not have jobs, reflecting the performance of the economy.

_Labor force_ is the sum of the employed and unemployed, and the _unemployment rate_ is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The _labor force participation rate_ is the percentage of the adult population that is in the labor force.    
The average rate of unemployment around which the economy fluctuates is called the _natural rate of unemployment_. It is the rate of unemployment towards which the economy gravitates. It should be noted that natural does not mean desirable.

# Lecture 27

We have $$L = E + U$$, where $$L$$ is the labor force, $$E$$ is the number of employed workers, and $$U$$ is the number of unemployed workers.    
The unemployment rate is $$U/L$$. The rate of job separation (severance rate) is denoted $$s$$ and the rate of job finding as $$f$$.    
Then, the number of people finding jobs is $$fU$$ and the number of people losing jobs is $$sE$$. In steady state, $$fU = sE$$. Equivalently,

$$\frac{U}{L} = \frac{s}{s+f}.$$

Any policy aimed at lowering the natural rate of unemployment should either reduce the rate of job separation $$s$$ or increase the rate of job finding $$f$$.

The two main reasons for unemployment are _job search_ and _wage rigidity_.    
Job search is the process of matching workers with appropriate jobs.

_Efficiency-wage theories_ propose another cause of wage rigidity. They claim that high wages make workers more productive. There are four theories related to this:

* An increase in wage allows workers to get a more nutritious diet, which increases productivity. They can pay more than the equilibrium wage to maintain a healthy workforce. This is mostly relevant in developing countries.
* Higher wage increases the workers' incentive to stay with the firm, which decreases hiring/training costs.
* The average quality of a firm's workforce depends on the wage it pays to its employees. If a firm decreases its wage, the best employees may take jobs elsewhere, leaving the firm with inferior employees - this is called the _adverse selection problem_.
* A high wage improves worker effort. The firm cannot monitor its employees. This is known as the _moral hazard problem_. The higher the wage, the greater the cost to the worker being fired.

When MNCs pay more wage than the equilibrium rate, the market is not cleared. Since the supply of labour is fixed, a higher supply means lower demand. This results in unemployment.

It was observed that most spells of unemployment are short, but most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term.    
The unemployment caused by the time it takes workers to search for a job is called _frictional unemployment_. Economists call a change in the composition of demand among industries or regions a _sectoral shift_.    
Since sectoral shifts are always occurring, there is always frictional unemployment. In an attempt to reduce frictional unemployment, some policies inadvertently increase it instead. An example of this is unemployment insurance. In this, workers collect a fraction of their wages for a certain period after losing their jobs. This decreases the incentive to find a new job. While economists agree that eliminating this will reduce the amount of unemployment, they disagree on whether it will enhance economic well-being.

Wage rigidity is the failure of wages to adjust until labour supply eqals the labour demand. The unemployment resulting from wage rigidity and job rationing is called _structural unemployment_. Workers are not unemployed because they cannot find a job that complements their skills, but because the labor supply is greater than the labor demand. This is the case because the real wage is stuck above the equilibrium level. This is the result of a minimum wage law above the equilibrium wage. It should be noted that efficiency-wage theories claim that even in the presence of a minimum wage or a surplus of workers, firms should set their wage far above the equilibrium wage.

In job search, people are searching for jobs that suit their skills to open up, whereas in the above example, people are waiting for jobs to open up.

Globalization is a major cause for increased competition around the world. Developing countries provide cheap labour so many companies relocate their manufacturing plants to these nations. So, workers who were previously involved in manufacturing may become unemployed.

# Lecture 28

In 1914, Ford started paying $5 per day to workers (against the prevailing $2 or $3 wage). According to Ford, this is in fact "the finest cost cutting move" he has ever made. The increase in wage increases the firm's productivity. Absenteeism fell by 75% and shop floor costs fell as well.

* Cyclical unemployment - This refers to the year-to-year fluctuations around its natural rate, which is associated with the short-run ups and downs of economic activity.
* Disguised unemployment
* Structural unemployment
* Seasonal unemployment - people may be hired only in summers
* Frictional unemployment
* Hidden unemployment - people not registered in the official statistics, underemployed people, and skilled people in low-skilled jobs.

Some workers, known as _discouraged workers_ claim to be unemployed but are not really trying to find a job.

A _union_ is a worker association that bargains with workers over wages, benefits, and working conditions. The process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment is referred to as _collective bargaining_. If an agreement is not reached, a union can withdraw labour, resulting in a _strike_. Union workers usually earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar workers who are not in unions. Unions just serve as an antidote against any market power that the firms that hire workers may possess.    
When the wage increases due to union activity, there is a decrease in demand for labour. This causes a conflict between "insiders", who are the union workers that gain from the increased wages, and the "outsiders", who do not get the union jobs. Workers not in unions bear some of the cost as well. Even if the unions have this adverse effect of pushing wages above the equilibrium level and causing unemployment, the advantage is that firms have a happy and productive workforce.      

The negative relationship between unemployment and GDP is called _Okun's law_. It is defined as

$$\text{\% change in real GDP} = \text{Relation between real GDP and unemployment} - 2\times\text{change in unemployment rate}.$$

Okun obtained the above by running a linear regression on the data.

Some problems in GDP measurement are:

* Illegal activities
* Tax avoidance (4-5% of earning population paying tax)
* Hoarding assets - gold for example    
	The above three are primarily in developing countries like India.
* Non-market transactions like a barter system in villages and payments to domestic servants. If a chef cooks food for his family, it is not counted, but it is if he cooks it for a customer at his restaurant. The value added to the raw ingredients is left out of the GDP. 
* Negative externalities - for example, degrading the soil results in the growth of the fertilizer industry.
* It does not take depletion of natural resources into account.
* It does not talk about the distribution of income.
* It does not measure changes in happiness. For example, higher GDP does not mean better education, but it does mean that the government can afford better education.

Is GDP a good measure of economic welfare?

* Growth and development are different. For example, a large fraction of India's GDP is in healthcare, but people's health has not significantly improved.
* GDP does not talk about equal distribution of wealth.
* Even if the GDP of a nation increases, the median income can go down.
