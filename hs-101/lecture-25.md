How do we measure cost of living?

We usually use the _Wholesale Price Index_ (WPI) to measure the level of prices or inflation. It consolidates the prices of several goods and services into a single index that measures the overall level of prices. To do this reliably, some options are:
* Compute the average of all prices. This treats all goods and services equally, which need not be the case.
* Take a the ratio of weighted averages of the prices while also considering a certain base year. For example, if we buy $$5$$ apples and $$2$$ oranges and take the base year as $$2011$$, we can calculate

$$\text{WPI} = \frac{5\times\text{current price of apples} + 2\times\text{current price of oranges}}{5\times\text{2011 price of apples} + 2\times\text{2011 price of oranges}}$$

The WPI is used to provide estimates of inflation at the wholesale transaction level for the economy as a whole. This allows the government to check for inflation, in essential commodities in particular. It is used as a deflator for many sectors of the economy, including estimating GDP. It is also used for indexation in business contracts. Global investors track the WPI as a key macro indicator for their investment decisions.

CPI

_Producer Price Index_ (PPI) measures the price of a typical basket of goods bought by firms, not consumers.
