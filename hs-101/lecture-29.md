The _financial institution_ is the group of institutions that helps match the savings of one person with the investments of another.    
_Financial markets_ are institutions through which savers can directly provide funds to borrowers. For example,
* The bond market. A _bond_ is a certificate of indebtedness.
* The stock market. A _stock_ is a claim to partial ownership in a firm.
_Financial intermediaries_ are institutions through which savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers. For example, banks and mutual funds (institutions that sell shares to the public and use the proceeds to buy portfolios of stocks and bonds).    
_Private savings_ refers to the portion of a household's income that is not used for consumption or paying taxes.

_National savings_ is the sum of the private savings and public savings. This is equal to

$$(\text{Y} - \text{T} - \text{C}) + (\text{T} - \text{G}) = \text{Y} - \text{C} - \text{G},$$

where $$\text{Y}$$ is the yearly income, $$\text{T}$$ is the taxes paid, $$\text{C}$$ is the consumption, and $$\text{G}$$ is the government purcahses. This is the portion of the national income that is used for neither consumption nor government purchases.    
Consider a closed economy case with $$\text{NX} = 0$$. Then the GDP is equal to $$C + I + G$$. Therefore, $$I$$ is equal to the national savings in a closed economy.

A _budget surplus_ is the excess of tax revenue over government purchases. A _budget deficit_ is the opposite.

_Investment_ is the purchase of new capital -- it is not just the purchase of stocks and bonds! It is anything that will give future returns.

The supply of loanable funds comes from savings. Households with extra income can loan it out to earn interest. Public savings, if positive, add to national savings and the supply of loanable funds. An increase in interest rate makes saving more attractive, which increases the quantity of loanable funds supplied. This reduces the demand for loanable funds, however. As in microeconomics, the interest rate adjusts to equate supply and demand.

An increase in budget deficit causes a fall in investment. The government borrows to finance its deficit, leaving less funds available for investment. This is known as _crowding out_.

Money is the yardstick with which we measure economic transactions and debts.
