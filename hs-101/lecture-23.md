Thus, we get the real GDP by considering a particular cost for the items.

We must take inflation into account when calculating the GDP. Further, it becomes difficult to compare different countries since the degree of inflation is different in different countries.

We tend to overestimate the rate of inflation and underestimate the rate of real economic growth when we consider the fact that earlier, people did not have modern conveniences.

As a result, to compensate for the shift in base year prices. We chain weight to average the prices.

Nominal GDP measures the current rupee value and real GDP measures output valued at constant prices. The _GDP deflator_, called the _implicit price deflator_, is equal to the ratio of the two, and measures the price of output relative to its price in the base year. It reflects what is happening to the level of prices in the economy.

The (real and nominal) per capita GDPs are of interest as well. Per capita growth should be looked at as well.

To resolve the problems in comparing GDP, we look at _purchasing power parity_. How much does a particular product cost in dollars in different countries? For example, a Starbucks grande latte costs $9.83 in Oslo but $2.80 in New Delhi.
