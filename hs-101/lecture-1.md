We look at things _marginally_ - the changes that occur when we make a small change to our consumption/supply.


5. Trade can make everyone better off.
People gain from their ability to trade and competition results in gains from trading. Trade allows people to specialize in what they want.
There is something called the Robinson Crusoe economy wherein there is no possibility of trade (Robinson Crusoe was the only person on the island). He had to produce all the goods for all his needs. This is a _protectionist_ approach and tries to make the units completely self-reliant. On the other hand, _liberalism_ asks people to focus on their strength and encourages trade.

6. Markets are a good way to organize economic activity.
A _market economy_ allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms as they interact in markets. It is a decentralist approach. Households/firms _separately_ decide who/what to hire/work for/buy/produce.
Adam Smith observed that households/firms act as if they are guided by an "invisible hand". Althought they act separately, the system doesn't crash. This invisible hand is just supply and demand.
Because households/firms look at prices when they make decisions, they unkowingly account for the social costs of their actions. Individual supply and demands get converted to social supply and demands, which results in the aggregating of individual entities. This results in decision makers to reach outcomes that maximise the welfare of society.

7. Sometimes, governments can improve market outcomes.
If left to their own, it is possible that agents reach inferior solutions. After independence, it was nearly completely centralized.
Markets work only if property rights are introduced. For free market economies to work and maximise societal welfare, it is necessary to ensure that the citizens' property rights are upheld.
_Market failure_ is said to occur when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently. If it fails, the government can intervene to promote efficience. Failure could occur due to 
	* lack of property rights.
	* an _externality_ - the impact of one person/firm's action on the well-being of a bystander. If we have an Adam Smith structure, it is difficult for externalities to occur. Externalities in general can be good or bad. Example. Passive smoking.
		<!-- Passive smoking of bystanders can be thought of as a bad externality. This isn't reflected in the private market as the price of cigarettes (in a free market economy), but is occurring nevertheless with bystanders being adversely affected. -->
    * _market power_, which is the ability of a single person/firm to influence market prices. Example. Monopolization.
