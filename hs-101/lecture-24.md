The GDP is the output produced within some geographic location. The GNI/GNP (Gross National Income/Product) is the output produced by the citizens of a geographic region. This value must be remitted back to the country. 

$$\text{GNP} = \text{GDP} + \text{Factor payments from abroad} - \text{Factor payments to abroad}$$

The _Net Domestic Product_ is equal to $$\text{GDP}-\text{Depreciation}$$ and the _Net National Product_ is equal to $$\text{GNP}-\text{Depreciation}$$. Depreciation is called "consumption of fixed capital". It is the cost of producing the output of the economy.
