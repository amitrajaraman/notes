We have $$L = E + U$$, where $$L$$ is the labor force, $$E$$ is the number of employed workers, and $$U$$ is the number of unemployed workers.    
The rate of unemployment is $$U/L$$. The rate of job separation (severance rate) is denoted $$s$$ and the rate of job finding as $$f$$.    
Then, the number of people finding jobs is $$fU$$ and the number of people losing jobs is $$sE$$. In steady state, $$fU = sE$$. Equivalently,

$$U/L = s/(s+f).$$

Any policy aimed at lowering the natural rate of unemployment should either reduce the rate of job separation $$s$$ or increase the rate of job finding $$f$$.    
The two main reasons for unemployment are _job search_ and _wage rigidity_.

_Efficiency-wage_ theories propose another cause of wage rigidity. They claim that high wages make workers more productive. There are three theories related to this:

* An increase in wage allows workers to get a more nutritious diet, which increases productivity.
* Higher wage increases the workers' incentive to stay with the firm, which decreases hiring/training costs.
* The average quality of a firm's workforce depends on the wage it pays to its employees. If a firm decreases its wage, the best employees may take jobs elsewhere, leaving the firm with inferior employees - this is called the _adverse selection problem_.

The unemployment caused by the time it takes workers to search for a job is called _frictional unemployment_, Economists call a change in the composition of demand among industries or regions a _sectoral shift_.    
Since sectoral shifts are always occurring, there is always frictional unemployment. In an attempt to reduce frictional unemployment, some policies inadvertently increase it instead. An example of this is _unemployment insurance_.

Wage rigidty is the failure of wages to adjust until labour supply eqals the labour demand.
