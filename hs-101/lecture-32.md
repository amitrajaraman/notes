* Reserve Requirements:
	* Cash reserve ratio (CRR) affects how much money banks can create by making loans (it is current 3%).
	* Statutory Liquid Ratio (SLR): The minimum percentage of deposits to be maintained by banks in the form of liquid cash, gold, or other securities (it is currently 18%).

	To increase the money supply, the RBI reduces RR. Banks make more loans from each rupee of reserves, which increases the money multiplier and mone supply.    
	To reduce the money supply, the CRR is raised and the process works in reverse.    
	The RBI rarely uses this because frequent changes would disrupt the banking system.

The _reverse repo rate_ is what the banks get when they deposit their excess funds in the RBI for short periods. _Basis points_ are often mentioned in monetary policy reviews. 1% is equivalent to 100 basis points. For example, if the reverse repo rate is 7.75% and the RBI increases it by 25 basis points, the new rate is 8%. It is currently 3.35%.

* The _discount rate_ or bank rate is the rate of interest which a central bank charges on its loans and advances to commerical banks (loans). The current bank rate is 4.25%.    
	The repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the RBI by selling their securities. It is currently 4%.    
	The reverse repo rate is the rate of interest offered by the RBI when banks deposit their surplus funds with the RBI for short periods. When banks have surplus funds but no lending/investment options, they deposit these funds with the RBI, which they do not earn interest on. Discount lending is used to provide extra liquidity when financial institutions are in trouble. Since this rarely occurs, RBI is a "lender of last resort".    
	The RBI raises the repo rate to increase the overall cost of funds in the banking system. higher cossts keeps the check on demand for funds. As the demand slows, the demand pull inflation slows as well. In a tight liquidity scenario, the repo rate acts as the base rate at which banks can borrow funds.    
	If the availability of funds is scarce and banks are unable to borrow at the repo rate, they may have to increase deposite rates to attract depositors.    
	There is a trade-off between inflation and growth.

When people suspect that their banks are in trouble, a _run on banks_ occurs where people go to withdraw their funds, holding more currency and less deposits. Under fractional-reserve banking, they do not have enough reserves to pay off all the depositors, so banks may have to close. Therefore, banks may make fewer loans and hold more reserves to satisfy depositors. These increase $$R$$, reverse the process of money creation, and cause the money supply to fall.

_Money demand_ refers to how much wealth people want to hold in liquid form. It depends on $$P$$. An increase in $$P$$ reduces the value of money, so more money is required to buy goods and services. The quantity of money demanded is negatively related to the value of money and positively related to $$P$$, other things equal.
