Ensure that when calculating (any) elasticity, you use the percentage change.    
The _cross-price elasticity_ measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good.

Until now, we haven't involved the government at all. In a free, unregulated system, the market forces establish equilibria. While they may be efficient, it needn't be true that everyone is satisfied in this case. It is the economists' duty to use theoriest to assist the development of policies.    

Price control is enacted only when these policy-makers believe that the market price is unfair to either the buyers or the sellers. This results in price ceilings (legal maximum price) and floors (legal minimum price).    
The price equilibrium is not binding if it is set above the equilibrium price and binding otherwise, resulting in a shortage.    

For example, rent control policy helps the poor by making pricing more affordable (for the poor).     
An example of a price floor is the minimum wage that is usually present.
