Recall the circular flow diagram, that represents the cyclic flow of money and goods/services/labor between households and firms.

The _gross domestic product_ (GDP) is the total market value of all final goods and services produced by factors of production located within a nation's borders. This measures the monetary value of the final output. 

_Intermediate goods_ are goods used up entirely in the production of final goods.    
The _value added_ is the dollar value of an industry's sales minus the value of the intermediate goods used in production.

There are several transactions that have nothing to do with final goods. As a result, we exclude things like stocks/bonds (securities), social security, unemployment compensation (government transfer payments), individual gifts, corporate gifts (private transfer payments) etc. We also exclude the transfer of second-hand goods (we have already made the purchase and it has been included in the value), household production, and legal/illegal underground transactions.    
That is, we want to count the sales of final goods that occur through the market.

Therefore, we measure the GDP as the sum of the
* national income:
	* compensation of employees
	* proprietor's income
	* corporate profits
	* net interest
	* rental income
* depreciation
* indirect taxes minus subsidies
* net factor payments to the rest of the world

In the expenditure approach,
* the consumption expenditure comprises
	* durable consumer goods (life span more than three years)
	* non-durable consumer goods (life span at most three years)
	* services (mental or physical help)
* gross private domestic investment
	* the creation of capital goods such as factories/machines that can yield production (and thus consumption). This also includes changes in business inventories and repairs made to machines and buildings.
