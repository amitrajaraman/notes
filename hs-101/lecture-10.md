Typically, the goal of the firm is to maximize profits. Sometimes, it may not be - consider the Indian railways. It may also be the goal to maximize sales (equivalently, revenue).    
A firm's cost of production includes all the opportunity costs of making the output. The cost of production for an accountant is thus quite different from that for an economist (since we include opportunity costs).    
When the total revenue exceeds both explicit and implicit costs, the firm earns economic profit. The economic profit is lower than the accounting profit.    
The _diminishing marginal product_ is the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases. This is similar to the idiom "Too many cooks spoil the broth".

The fixed costs are incurred irrespective of how much we make. Variable costs depend on the quantity of output we produce. An example of the former is the rent for the office space.

The _marginal cost_ measures the increase in total cost that arises from an extra unit of production - the slope of the total cost function (if it is a continuous cost).    
Marginal cost increases with the amount of output produced - this reflects the concept of diminishing marginal product. Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output due to this, diminishing marginal product will set in at some point of time.    
If the marginal cost is greater than the average total cost, the average goes up.
