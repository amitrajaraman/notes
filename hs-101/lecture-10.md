Typically, the goal of the firm is to maximize profits. Sometimes, it may not be - consider the Indian railways. It may also be the goal to maximize sales (equivalently, revenue).    
The _total revenue_ is the amount a firm receives for the sale of its output.    
The _total cost_ is the market value of the inputs the firm uses in production.    
The _profit_ is the total revenue minus the total cost.

_Explicit costs_ are costs that require money, whereas _implicit costs_ are costs that do not (such as opportunity costs). As a result, the _accounting profit_ is thus quite different from the _economic profit_ (since we include opportunity costs in the latter).    
When the total revenue exceeds both explicit and implicit costs, the firm earns economic profit. The economic profit is lower than the accounting profit due to the extra opportunity costs incurred.

The relationship between quantity of input and quantity of output is called the _production function_.

The _marginal product_ of any input in the production process is the increase in output obtained from one additional unit of input. As input increases, the marginal product decreases. This property is known as _diminishing marginal product_. This is similar to the idiom "Too many cooks spoil the broth". As marginal product declines, the production function grows flatter.

_Fixed costs_ do not vary with the quantity of output (for example, office space rent) whereas _variable costs_ depend on the quantity of output (for example, the total salaries of workers). The total cost is equal to the sum of the two.

The _average total cost_ is the total cost divided by the quantity of output $$\text{TC}/\text{Q}$$. Similarly, we can define _average fixed cost_ and _average variable cost_.    
The _marginal cost_ is the amount the cost increases on increasing production by one unit of output. It is equal to the slope of the total cost function $$\Delta\text{TC}/\Delta\text{Q}$$.

The _marginal cost_ is the slope of the total cost function (if it is a continuous cost).

Marginal cost increases with the amount of output produced - this reflects the concept of diminishing marginal product.    
The average total cost curve is U-shaped. This is because the average fixed cost decreases whereas the average variable cost increases due to diminishing marginal product.    
The average total cost rises (falls) when the marginal cost is greater (less) than than the average total cost.

<!-- Typically, the goal of the firm is to maximize profits. Sometimes, it may not be - consider the Indian railways. It may also be the goal to maximize sales (equivalently, revenue).    
A firm's cost of production includes all the opportunity costs of making the output. The cost of production for an accountant is thus quite different from that for an economist (since we include opportunity costs).    
When the total revenue exceeds both explicit and implicit costs, the firm earns economic profit. The economic profit is lower than the accounting profit.    
The _diminishing marginal product_ is the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases. This is similar to the idiom "Too many cooks spoil the broth".

The fixed costs are incurred irrespective of how much we make. Variable costs depend on the quantity of output we produce. An example of the former is the rent for the office space.

The _marginal cost_ measures the increase in total cost that arises from an extra unit of production - the slope of the total cost function (if it is a continuous cost).    
Marginal cost increases with the amount of output produced - this reflects the concept of diminishing marginal product. Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output due to this, diminishing marginal product will set in at some point of time.    
If the marginal cost is greater than the average total cost, the average goes up. -->
