In a _fractional reserve banking system_, banks keep a fraction of deposits as reserves and the rest to make loans. The RBI sets _reserve requirements_, which are regulations on the minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold against deposits. Banks may hold more than this minimum amount. The _reserve ratio_ $$R$$

A _T-account_ is a simplified accounting statement that shows a bank's assets and liabilities.

The _money multiplier_ is the amount of money the banking system generates with each dollar of reserves. It is equal to $$1/R$$.

The quantity of money available is called the _money supply_. The control over the money supply is called _monetary policy_. In india, it is conducted by a partially independent institution called the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The three tools it uses are:

* Open-Market Operations (OMOs): The purchase and sale of Indian government bonds by the RBI.
	To increase money supply, they buy bonds, paying with new dollars, which are deposited in banks increasing reserves, which banks use to make loans causing money supply to expand.
	To reduce money supply, they sell government bonds, taking dollars out of circulation and the process works in reserve.
	OMOs are easy to conduct and are the RBI's monetary policy tool of choice.
