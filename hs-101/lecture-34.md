In the long run, real GDP grows around 5% per year on average. In the short run however, it fluctuates around its trend. A _recession_ is a period of falling real incomes and rising unemployment. A _depression_ is a severe recession.    
These short-run economic fluctuations are often called _business cycles_.
* Economic fluctuations are irregular and unpredictable.

Explaining these fluctuations is difficult, and the theory of economic fluctuations is controversial. We usually use the model of _aggregate demand and aggregate supply_. This differs from classical long-run theories.    
In the short run, changes in nominal variables (like $$\text{P}$$) can affect real variables (like $$\text{Y}$$).

The _aggregate demand curve_ shows the quantity of all goods and services demand in the economy at a given price level. If $$P$$ rises,
* $$\text{C}$$ falls (the wealth effect). People can buy fewer goods and services with the money they hold, so real wealth is lower, people feel poorer, and $$\text{C}$$ falls.
* interest rate $$\text{I}$$ rises (the interest rate effect). Buying goods and services requires more money, so people sell bonds or other assets, driving up interest rate (the demand for money is increasing).
* $$\text{NX}$$ increases (the exchange rate effect). Interest rates rise, so foreign investors desire more Indian bonds, the Indian exchange rate appreciates, and $$\text{NX}$$ increases.

The aggregate demand curve can shift due to
* changes in $$\text{C}$$, due to a stock market boom/crash or tax hikes/cuts, etc.
* changes in $$\text{I}$$, due to firms buying new equipment or expectations changing.
* changes in $$\text{G}$$.
* changes in $$\text{NX}$$, due to booms/recessions in countries that buy exports, or appreciation/depreciation from international speculation in the foreign exchange market.

The _aggregate supply curve_ shows the quantity of the total quantity of goods and services firms produce and sell at any given price level. It is upward sloping in the short run and vertical in the long run.    
The _natural rate of output_ ($$Y_N$$) is the amount of output the economy produces when unemployment is at its natural rate. It is determined by the economy's stocks of labour, capital, natural resources, and level of technology, which remain somewhat constant in the long run (an increase in $$P$$ does not affect any of these).
