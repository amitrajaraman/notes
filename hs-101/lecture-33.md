A quantity equation attempts to link the money supplied to the number of transactions made. The quantity theory of money says

$$MV = PT,$$

where $$m$$ is the quantity of money supplied, $$v$$ is the _transaction velocity of money_, which is the number of times a rupee exchanges hands, $$p$$ is the price of a typical transaction (the number of rupees exchange), and $$T$$ is the number of transactions made in a year.    
However, it is very difficult to measure $$T$$ so we cannot easily compute $$V$$, how do we solve this? We replace the number of transactions $$T$$ with the total output of the economy $$Y$$ (real GDP). The more the economy produces, the more goods are bought and sold. They are technically not the same, for example because second-hand goods should be counted in $$T$$ but are not in $$Y$$.    
$$V$$ in this new equation $$MV = PY$$ is called the _income velocity of money_.
Observe that since $$Y$$ is the amount of output and $$P$$ is the price of one unit of output, $$PY$$ is just the nominal GDP.    
$$M/P$$ is referred to as the _real money balance_, which measures the purchasing power of a stock of money.

$$(M/P)_d = kY.$$

The money demand function is similar to the demand function for a good. Since the demand for money balance should be equal to the supply, we get $$M/P = kY$$, so the income velocity is $$1/k$$. This shows the link between demand and velocity.    
If we hold a lot of money for each rupee of income ($$k$$ is large), $$V$$ is small and money changes hands frequently. Similarly, if $$k$$ is small, then $$V$$ is large.    
The factors of production and production function determine the level of output $$Y$$. The money supply determines the nominal value of output $$PY$$. The price level $$P$$ is thus the ratio of the nominal value of output $$PY$$ to the real value of output $$Y$$.

The revenue raised by printing of money is called _seigniorage_. A government can finance its spending in three ways - raising revenue through taxes, borrowing from public by selling bonds, and printing money.    
The government itself does not print money, it asks the RBI to print it instead.    
Seigniorage causes an increase in money supply, which causes inflation. The printing of money to increase revenue is like imposing an _inflation tax_.

The _Fisher effect_ gives the distinction between the real and nominal rate of interest. It says $$i = r + \pi$$, where $$i$$ is the (market) nominal rate of interest, $$r$$ is the real rate of interest, and $$\pi$$ is the inflation.

The _modified Fisher effect_ says $$i = r + \pi^e$$. $$r$$ is the _ex-ante real interest rate_, which is determined by the equilibirium in the market as described by the GE model. $$\pi^e$$ is the expected inflation and $$i$$ the nominal interest rate.    
The nominal interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money - it is what is given up by holding money instead of bonds.

The inconvenience of reduced money holding is called the _shoe-leather cost_ of inflation. When changes in inflation require printing and distributing new pricing information, these costs are called _menu costs_. Due to variable prices, inefficient allocation of resources can also occur.
