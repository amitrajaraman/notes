Money is the stock of assets that can be readily used to make actions. The stock of money is made of the rupees in the hands of the public. The three main uses of money are to serve as a
* store of value: It is a way to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future.
* unit of account: It can be used to measure economic transactions and debts.
* medium of exchange: It is used to buy goods and services, as a legal tender from the government.

In a system without money, we can either be completely self-sufficient, or use a barter economy. The latter requires a "double coincidence of wants" - each person has something that the other wants. Nowadays, this is highly unlikely with the huge variety in goods.    
Money allows for more indirect transactions. _Liquidity_ refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted to the economy's medium of exchange. For example, money is the most liquid asset, stocks and bonds are still relatively liquid (but less so than money), and an antique painting is less liquid.

_Fiat money_ is money by declaration. It has no intrinsic value. For example, rupee or dollar.    
_Commodity money_ on the other hand does have intrinsic value and can be used for some purpose. For example, gold or tobacco. When we use gold as money, the economy is said to be on a _gold standard_.

There is a general shift from commodity money to Fiat money, primarily because the latter is much more standardized.    
<!-- Suppose instead that we use gold to pay for goods. Then we first need to ensure purity and weight, so the government might get involved to reduce transaction costs. To reduce these costs, the government can either mint gold coins of a known purity and weight, or accept gold from the public in exchange for gold certificates, which can be redeemed for a certain quantity of gold.    
The bills are just as valuable as the gold itself, but are easier to use in a transaction. This marks the natural shift from commodity money to fiat money, with everyone eventually carrying these bills instead of gold. -->

The _money supply_ or _money stock_ refers to the amount of money available in the economy. It includes both _currency_ (the paper bills and coins in the hands of the public) and _demand deposits_ (balances in savings accounts that depositors can access on demand).    
If most sellers accept cheques, assets in savings accounts are as convenient as currency.
<!-- There are three types of money in India:
* M0 is _reserve money_ - the currency in circulation, other deposits in RBI, and bankers' deposits with RBI.
* M1 is _narrow money_ - it is M0 excluding cash with banks and including demand deposits.
* M3 is _broad money_ - it is M1 together with time deposits.-->
