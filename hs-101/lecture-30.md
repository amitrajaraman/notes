If we don't have money, we can either be completely self-sufficient, or use a barter economy. Without money, in a barter economy, trade requires a "double coincidence of wants" - each person has something that the other wants. Nowadays, this is highly unlikely.    
Money allows for more indirect transactions.

_Fiat money_ is money by declaration. It has no intrinsic value.    
_Commodity money_ on the other hand does have intrinsic value and can be used for some purpose.

There is a general shift from commodity money to Fiat money, primarily because the latter is much more standardized. Transaction costs are reduced.

The _money supply_ or _money stock_ refers to the amount of money available in the economy. It includes both _currency_ (the paper bills and coins in the hands of the public) and _demand deposits_ (balances in bank accounts that depositors can access on demand).    
If most sellers accept cheques, assets in savings accounts are as convenient as currency.

<!-- There are three types of money in India:
* M0 is _reserve money_ - the currency in circulation, other deposits in RBI, and bankers' deposits with RBI.
* M1 is _narrow money_ - it is M0 excluding cash with banks and including demand deposits.
* M3 is _broad money_ - it is M1 together with time deposits.
