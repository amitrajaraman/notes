The long-run aggregate supply curve is affected by
* change in natural rate of unemployment because of
	* immigration
	* retirement
	* government policies to reduce the natural unemployment rate
* change in $$K$$ or $$H$$ because of
	* investment in equipment
	* higher education rate
	* destruction of factories due to some natural disaster
* changes in natural resources because of
	* discovery of new mineral deposits
	* reduction in supply of imported oils
	* changing weather patterns
* changes in technology because of productivity improvements from technological procss

The short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. An increase in $$P$$ causes an increase in the amount of goods and services supplied.

There are three theories of SRAS. In each, there is s

* According to the _sticky-wage theory_, nominal wages are sticky in the short run and adjust sluggishly.    
	If $$P > P_E$$, the revenue is higher but not the labour cost. Production is profitable, so output/unemployment increase and $$Y$$ increases.
* According to the _sticky-price theory_, prices are sticky in the short run and adjust sluggishly. This may be due to menu costs, which is the cost of adjusting prices.    
	If money supply is increased, then $$P$$ rises in the long run. Firms with menu costs wait to raise prices, so the demand increases and output/unemployment increases as well, which increases $$Y$$.
* According to the _misperceptions theory_, firms may confuse changes in $$P$$ with changes in the relative price of the products they sell.    
	If $$P$$ goes above $$P_E$$, then a firm sees its own price rise before realizing that all prices are rising. So, thinking that its relative price is increasing, it may increase the output/unemployment, which increases $$Y$$.

In all three theories, $$Y$$ deviates from $$Y_N$$ when $$P$$ deviates from $$P_E$$.

$$Y = Y_N + a(P-P_E),$$

where $$a > 0$$ measures how much $$Y$$ responds to changes in $$P$$. The imperfections in these theories are only short-run, and the stickiness disappears in the long run.

Fiscal policies are undertaken by the government, and monetary policies by the central bank.
* _Expansionary_ fiscal policy increases $$G$$ and/or decreases $$T$$ (it shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right).
* _Contractionary_ fiscal policy decreases $$G$$ and/or increases $$T$$ (it shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left).
