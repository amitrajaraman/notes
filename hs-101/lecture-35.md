Some factors that shift the long-run aggregate supply curve are
* change in labour because of
	* immigration
	* retirement
	* government policies to reduce the natural unemployment rate     
	An increase in labour would shift the curve to the right (more goods/services are produced).
* change in capital because of
	* investment in equipment
	* higher education rate (human capital)
	* destruction of factories due to some natural disaster    
	An increase in capital would shift the curve to the right.
* changes in natural resources because of
	* discovery of new mineral deposits
	* reduction in supply of imported oils
	* changing weather patterns     
	An increase in the availability of resources would shift the curve to the right. It should be noted that it can even shift due to the availability of resources abroad, events in the global oil market for example.
* changes in technology because of productivity improvements from technological process. If they get more advanced, the curve shifts to the right.

In the long run, the aggregate supply curve gradually shifts to the right (due to technological progress) and so does the aggregate demand (due to an increase in money supply). The short-term occurrences should be viewed as deviations from this general trend of output growing and presence of inflation.

The short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. An increase in the price level raises the amount of goods and services supplied. Three theories that attempt to explain this are:

* According to the _sticky-wage theory_, nominal wages are sticky in the short run and adjust sluggishly.    
	If the price level is greater than expected, the revenue is higher but not the labour cost. Production is profitable, so output and employment increase.
* According to the _sticky-price theory_, prices are sticky in the short run and adjust sluggishly.    
	This may be due to menu costs, which is the cost of adjusting prices. Suppose the price level is greater than expected. Then firms with menu costs wait to raise prices, so sales increase, and output and employment increase as well.
* According to the _misperceptions theory_, firms may confuse changes in price level with changes in the relative price of the products they sell.    
	If the price level increases more than expected, then a firm sees its own price rise before realizing that all prices are rising. So, thinking that its relative price is increasing, it may increase output and employment as well.

The short-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right whenever the price level decreases (compared to the expected).

In all three theories, $$Y$$ deviates from $$Y_N$$ when $$P$$ deviates from $$P_E$$.

$$Y = Y_N + a(P-P_E),$$

where $$a > 0$$ measures how much $$Y$$ responds to changes in $$P$$. The imperfections in these theories are only short-run, and the stickiness disappears in the long run.

Fiscal policies are undertaken by the government, and monetary policies by the central bank.
* _Expansionary_ fiscal policy increases $$G$$ and/or decreases $$T$$ (it shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right).
* _Contractionary_ fiscal policy decreases $$G$$ and/or increases $$T$$ (it shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left).
