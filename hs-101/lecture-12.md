The short-run supply curve has the portion of the marginal cost curve that is above the average variable cost curve. The long-run supply curve has the portion of the marginal cost curve that is above the average total cost curve.    
In the long run, the price is equal to the minimum of the average total cost.    
An increase in demand raises price and quantity in the short run. Firms then earn positive economic profits.

While a competitive firm is a price taker, a monopoly firm is a _price maker_. A firm is considered a monopoly if it is the sole seller of its product and its product does not have any close substitutes. Monopolies arise when there is a barrier to entry:
* Ownership of a key resource.
* The government gives a single firm the exclusive right to produce some good.
* Costs of production make a single producer more efficient than a large number of producers. An industry is a _natural monopoly_ if a single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market at a smaller cost than could two or more firms. Consider the railways in India.
