_Laissez faire_ is the policy of leaving enough for everyone.

If a market system is not perfectly competitive, market power is the ability to influence prices.    
The resulting inefficiency shows itself as _deadweight loss_.    
When buyers/sellers do not take externalities into account, the equilibrium could be inefficient. 

The theory of consumer choice asks
* whether all demand curves slope downward,
* how wages affect labor supply, and
* how interest rates affect household saving.

_Budget constraint_ depicts the limit on the consumption "bundles" that a consumer can afford. This shows the various combinations of goods that the consumer can afford given their income and the prices. The slope of the curve is equal to the ratio of the two prices.    
We should also take preferences into account. For this, we draw the indifference curve.

The slope at any point on an indifference curve is the _marginal rate of substitution_. It represents how much of one good the consumer is willing to give up for one unit of the other.
