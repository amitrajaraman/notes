If a firm has the first mover's advantage, they have a good chance of naturally establishing a monopoly. It becomes quite difficult for new people to enter the market.

_Price discrimination_ is the practice of selling the same good at different prices to different customers, even though the costs of production are the same.    
To price discriminate, the firm must have market power. In perfect price discrimination, the monopolist knows the willingness to pay of each customer and charges each customer a different price.
