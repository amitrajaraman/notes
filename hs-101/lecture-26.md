The _HSBC Purchasing Manager Index_ (PMI) measures the factory production based on the monthly responses of purchasing executives in around 500 manufacturing companies. A value over 50 means expansion and a value under 50 means contraction.

The GDP deflator measures the prices of all goods produced, whereas the WPI measures only ht prices of goods/services bought by consumers. In particular, an increase in the price of goods bought by firms/government shows up in the former but not the latter. Also, imported goods are not part of the GDP and do not show up in the GDP deflator. Lastly, the WPI assigns fixed weights to the prices of different goods whereas the GDP deflator assigns changing weights.

We use two indices in general, the _Laspeyres index_ (which works with a fixed basket of goods) and the _Paasche index_ (which works with a changing basket of goods)

The Laspeyres price index is equal to

$$P = \frac{\sum p_t q_0}{\sum p_0 q_0} \times 100 $$

and the Paasche price index is equal to

$$P = \frac{\sum p_t q_0}{\sum p_0 q_t} \times 100, $$
where $$P$$ is the price index, $$p_t$$ is the current price, $$q_t$$ is the quantity used in the current period, $$p_0$$ is the price of the base period, and $$q_0$$ is the quantity used in the base period.

Laspeyres requires quantity data from only the base period, which allows a more meaningful comparison, but may overweight goods whose prices increase and does not reflect changes in buying patterns over time.    
Paasche reflects current buying habits because it uses current quantities, but it requires quantity data from the current year. It is difficult to attribute changes in the index to price changes alone and tends to overweight goods whose prices have declined. The prices need to be recomputed each year.

The Fischer index is equal to the geometric mean of these two indices.

_Unemployment rate_ is the statistic that measures the percentage of people who want to work but do not have jobs, reflecting the performance of the economy.

_Labor force_ is the sum of the employed and unemployed, and the _unemployment rate_ is the perecentage of the labor force that is unemployed.    
The average rate of unemployment around which the economy fluctuates is called the _natural rate of unemployment_. It is the rate of unemployment towards which the economy gravitates.
