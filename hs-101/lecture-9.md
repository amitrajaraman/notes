Governments levy _taxes_ to raise revenue for public projects. Taxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity sold is reduced. Both buyers and sellers share this tax burden.

_Tax incidence_ studies who bears the burden of a tax. Regardless of it, buyers pay more and sellers receive less.    
A tax on buyers shifts the demand curve downwards by the amount of tax.    
Similarly, a tax on sellers shifts the supply curve upward by the amount of tax.    
This means that no matter where the tax is levied,

For a payroll tax, the difference between the wage the firm pays and what the worker receives is called the _tax wedge_, which is just the volume of the tax that goes to the government.

If we have an inelastic supply and elastic demand, the majority of the tax incidence goes to the sellers. The burden falls on the less elastic side of the market -- the desperation is taken advantage of.
