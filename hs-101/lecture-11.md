In the short run, some costs are fixed. In the long run, all fixed costs become variable costs.    
As a result, a firm's long-run cost curves differ from its short-run cost curves. The lower envelope of the short-run total average cost curve forms the long-run total average cost curve. 

_Economies of scale_ refer to the property whereby long-run average total cost falls as the quantity of output increases.    
_Diseconomies of scale_ refer to the property whereby long-run average total cost rises as the quantity of output increases.    
_Constant economies of scale_ refer to the property whereby long-run average total cost stays constant as the quantity of output increases.

A _competitive market_ has many buyers and sellers trading identical products so that each buyer and seller is a price taker. They must accept the price determined by the market.

In a _perfectly competitive market_, firms can further freely enter/exit the market. So, the actions of any single buyer/seller have negligible impact on the market price. The average revenue equals the price of the good. The total revenue is proportional to the output.    
In the short run, it is difficult to leave the market whereas it is easy in the long run. A _shutdown_ refers to a short run decision to not produce anything in some period of time due to market conditions. _Exit_ refers to a long run decision to leave the market. The firm shuts down if the revenue is less than the average variable cost. The firm exists if the revenue is less than the average total cost.

Profit is maximised when the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost.
