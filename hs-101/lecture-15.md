* Higher indifference curves are preferred.
* Indifference curves slope downwards.
* Indifference curves do not cross.
* Indifference curves are bowed inwards. (People are more willing to trade away goods they have in abundance)

_Perfect substitutes_ are goods with straight-line indifference curves. As a result, the marginal rate of substitution is constant. For example, nickels and dimes.    
Goods with right-angle indifference curves are _perfect complements_. For example, left shoes and right shoes.    
The consumer chooses to consume such that the marginal rate of substitution is equal to the relative price. We are just equating the slope of the indifference curve and the slope of the budget constraint. At the optimum, the valuation of the two goods equals the market's valuation.

The _substitution effect_ is the change in consumption that ccurs when a price change moves the consumer along an indifference curve to a point with a different marginal rate of substitution (along the indifference curve). The _income effect_ is the change in consumption that results when a price change moves the consumer to a higher or lower indifference curve.
