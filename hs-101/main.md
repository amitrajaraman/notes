## Lecture 1

_Economics_ is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.

1. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The common trade-off is between efficiency (society is making the best of the scarce resources) and equality (benefits are distributed equally).

2. The _opportunity cost_ of an item is what we give up to get something - the greatest cost in going to college is not money, but time, which is an opportunity cost.

3. Economists assume that people are rational and look at things _marginally_ - the changes that occur when we make a small change to our plan of action. Rational people make decisions by looking at marginal benefits and costs.

4. People respond to incentives. When policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, there are often unintended consequences. Example: see page 8 (seatbelt law)

5. Trade can make everyone better off. People gain from their ability to trade and competition results in gains from trading. Trade allows people to specialize in what they want.
There is something called the Robinson Crusoe economy wherein there is no possibility of trade (Robinson Crusoe was the only person on the island). He had to produce all the goods for all his needs. This is a _protectionist_ approach and tries to make the units completely self-reliant. On the other hand, _liberalism_ asks people to focus on their strength and encourages trade.

6. Markets are (usually) a good way to organize economic activity. A _market economy_ allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms as they interact in markets. It is a decentralist approach. Households/firms _separately_ decide who/what to hire/work for/buy/produce.
Adam Smith observed that households/firms act as if they are guided by an "invisible hand". Althought they act separately, the system doesn't crash. This invisible hand is just supply and demand and prices are the instrument using which 「the hand」 directs market activity.
Because households/firms look at prices when they make decisions, they unkowingly account for the social costs of their actions. Individual supply and demands get converted to social supply and demands, which results in the aggregating of individual entities. This results in decision makers to reach outcomes that maximise the welfare of society.
When this invisible hand is disrupted (perhaps by the government), there can be adverse affects such as how taxes adversely affect resource allocation.

7. Governments can improve market outcomes. The invisible hand only works if the government enforces the rules and maintains the key institutions. If left to their own, it is possible that agents reach inferior solutions. After independence, it was nearly completely centralized. Markets work only if property rights are introduced. For free market economies to work and maximise societal welfare, it is paramount to ensure that the citizens' property rights are upheld.
_Market failure_ is said to occur when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently. If it fails, the government can intervene to promote efficiency. Failure could occur due to 
	* lack of property rights.
	* an _externality_ - the impact of one person/firm's action on the well-being of a bystander. If we have an Adam Smith structure, it is difficult for externalities to occur. Externalities in general can be good or bad. Example. Passive smoking.
		<!-- Passive smoking of bystanders can be thought of as a bad externality. This isn't reflected in the private market as the price of cigarettes (in a free market economy), but is occurring nevertheless with bystanders being adversely affected. -->
    * _market power_, which is the ability of a single person/firm to influence market prices. An example is monopolization.


## Lecture 2

Economists make assumptions to simplify the study of the surrounding world. For example, we may assume that prices don't change too much in the short run.

The _circular flow diagram_ is a visual model of the economy that shows how money flows through markets among households and firms. The inputs to firms such as labor, land, and capital, are called the _factors of production_. The two major markets involved are:
* Markets for goods and services (firms sell and households buy)
* Markets for factors of production (households sell and firms buy)

The circular flow diagram doesn't show everything, factors such as the government and international trade are not shown at all.

The _production possibilities frontier_ is a graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can produce given the available factors of production and technology.

An outcome is _efficient_ if the economy is getting all it can given the constraints. Points on (not inside) the PPF such as A, B, E, F represent efficient outcomes. Note that the PPF shows one of the trade-offs we may face. It also shows the opportunity cost of one good measured in terms of another good.    
Further note that if we are at, say, F, then the workers who are skilled in car-related areas are also working on computers. The PPF usually has this shape and is steeper towards the middle. If the techonology for something becomes better, then the PPF will expand along the corresponding axis.    
Obviously, it is extremely difficult to get the exact PPF. It is the duty of the government to introduce suitable taxes/subsidies to ensure that the outcome is efficient.
