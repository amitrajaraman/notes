The _price elasticity of supply_ measures how much the quantity supplied changes with the price. If the supply changes substantially with a change in price, it is said to be _elastic_. If not, it is called _inelastic_.     
A _perfectly inelastic supply_ is one where the quantity supplied does not depend on the price at all. An example of this is beach-front land - irrespective of the price, there is a constant total amount.
