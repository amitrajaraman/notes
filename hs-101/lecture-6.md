Price is the explanatory variable and supply/demand is the dependent variable. If the curve is mapped with price on the X-axis, it is sometimes known as the inverse supply/demand curve.

The _price elasticity of supply_ is a measure of how much the quantity produced changes with the price. It is equal to the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by percentage change in price. Observe that it is always negative. This can be rewritten as $$(\Delta y/\Delta x)/(y/x)$$.    
A _perfectly inelastic_ supply is one where the quantity supplied does not depend on the price at all. For example, beach-front land.    
It quantifies how much the sellers can change the amount of goods they produce.    

We can similarly define the price elasticity of demand and related parameters.
