Similar to the price elasticity of supply, we define the _price elasticity of demand_. When analyzing it, we must consider
* availability of subtitutes - more substitutes implies higher elasticity,
* necessities versus luxuries - luxury implies higher elasticity,
* definition of the market (how big/small the market is), and
* time horizon (how long we have to adjust) - longer time horizon implies higher elasticity.
The price elasticity of demand, similar to that of supply, is defined by

$$\frac{(Q_2-Q_1)/((Q_1+Q_2)/2)}{(P_2-P_1)/((P_1+P_2)/2)}$$

The demand is said to be _inelastic_ if the absolute value of price elasticity is between $$0$$ and $$1$$ and _elastic_ if the absolute value is greater than one. If equal to one, the demand is called _unitary_. In a _perfectly inelastic_ demand curve, the quantity demanded does not change with the price (vertical demand curve). In a _perfectly elastic demand_, the quantity demanded does not change infinitely on change of price (horizontal demand curve).

The _total revenue_ is equal to the price multiplied by the quantity. Note that in a perfectly inelastic situation, reducing the price results in the total revenue decreasing proportionately.

If the demand curve decreases linearly, then it goes from elastic to unit elastic to inelastic as demand increases.

The _income elasticity of demand_ is the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. For inferior goods, it is negative and for normal goods, it is positive.
