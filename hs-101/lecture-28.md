In 1914, Ford started paying $5 per day to workers (against the prevailing $2 or $3 wage). According to Ford, this is in fact "the finest cost cutting move" he has ever made. The increase in wage increases the firm's productivity. Absenteeism fell by 75% and shop floor costs fell as well.

* Cyclical unemployment - This refers to the year-to-year fluctuations around its natural rate, which is associated with the short-run ups and downs of economic activity.
* Disguised unemployment - 
* Structural unemployment - 
* Seasonal unemployment - people may be hired only in summers
* Frictional unemployment
* Hidden unemployment - people not registered in the official statistics, underemployed people, and skilled people in low-skilled jobs.


The negative relationship between unemployment is called _Okun's law_. It is defined as

$$\text{Percentage change in real GDP} = \text{Relation between real GDP and unemployment} - 2\times\text{the change in the unemployment rate}.$$

Okun obtained the above by running a linear regression on  the data.

Some problems in GDP measurement are:

* Illegal activities
* Tax avoidance (10% of earning population paying tax)
* Hoarding assets - gold for example
* Negative externalities - for example, degrading the environment results in the growth of the fertilizer industry. It does not take natural resources into account.
* It does not measure changes in happiness
