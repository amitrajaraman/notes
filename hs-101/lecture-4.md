_Market demand_ refers to the sum of all the individual demands for a particular good. Individual demand curves can be summed horizontally (the quantities sum up) to obtain the market demand curve.

When/how does the demand curve shift? What are the "other things" in the law of demand? The demand curve shifting rightwards corresponds to an increase in demand. The relevant parameters are:

* Consumer income - As income increases, the demand for a normal good will increase and the demand for an inferior good will decrease.
* Prices of related goods - When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, they are called _substitutes_. When a fall increases the demand, they are called _complements_.
* Expectations - If expectations for the future increase, then demand increases (_self-fulfilling expectations_), even if there is no logical reason for the rise of expectation in the first place.
* Tastes - If the tastes become more tailored towards the product, then demand increases.
* Number of buyers - As the number of buyers increase, the demand increases.

The supply schedule/supply curve are the counterparts of the demand schedule/demand curve, they tabulate/graph the price versus the quantity supplied. The parameters for the law of supply are:

* Input prices
* Technology
* Expectations
* Number of sellers
