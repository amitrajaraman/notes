The GDP can be looked at as either the total expenditure on domestically produced final goods/services or the total income earned by domestically located factors of production.    
Expenditure and income are equal because any money spent by the buyer becomes income to the seller.

The expenditure components of GDP are consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.    
Investment includes business fixed investment, residential fixed investment, and inventory investment. Investment is basically spending on new capital.

A _stock_ is a quantity measured at a point of time. A _flow_ is a quantity measured per unit time. For example, GDP is a flow measure.

The government spending excludes transfer payments (like say unemployment insurance payments) because they are not spending on goods and services. Therefore, we have

$$Y = C + I + G + NX,$$

where $$C$$ is the consumption, $$I$$ is the investment, $$G$$ is the government spending, and $$NX$$ is the net export. The left is the value of total output and the right is the aggregate expenditure.

Price is a common unit using which we can measure other expenditures. We must fix the base year if we want to compare production. We then only compare a different year's production by taking the prices as the base year's prices.

A firm's _value added_ is the value of its output minus the value of the intermediate goods used to produce that output. GDP can also be seen as the net value added across firms.
