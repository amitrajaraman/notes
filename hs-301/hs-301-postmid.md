## Lecture 1

Now, we look at the more modern philosophers. The notable modern philosophers we shall look at are Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, and Hume. The primary schools of thought are rationalism and empiricism.

During the Renaissance, the power of the church gradually shifted to the state. There were also large changes in socio-economic structure, with the rise of economic individualism (_laissez faire_).     
Reason was viewed as a higher authority now, with truth being something acquired by free and unbiased inquiry. People began to reflect on more natural things. There was large practical application of science in technology and medicine. Due to this, there were large changes in religion and morality, with many rules being articulated, leaving behind religion.     
Reason is rationalistic in the sense that it makes reason the highest authority, seeking to explain things in a scientific manner. Rationalists thus seek to be absolutely certain of knowledge (in a non-empirical way).    
Rationalistis such as Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza believed in a priori truth, while empiricists such as Bacon, Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume believed in a posteriori truth.

Bacon said that human knowledge must have a firm, sold foundation. He had supreme self-confidence and optimism. The primary method of science is induction, and social order must be discovered in science. To summarize, the model of knowledge is natural science, the method is induction, and the goal is invention.    
This new scientific spirit was known as _novum organum_. Methodical observation and experimentation was done in natural science. The role of mathematics was not ruled out, however. The mind was tried to be freed from prejudices (_idolas_). For example, the _idola of the tribes_ is that of human desire (_teleology_). The _idola of the den_ (_specus_) deals with one's individual dispositions, education, and authority admired. The _idola fori_ (idolas of the market) deals with the association of words and names of actual objects with abstract things. The _idola of theatre_ is the result of false theories/philosophies.    
Induction is not merely enumeration. Instead, knowledge should discover the form of a given quality. The explanation of fact by a law is the foundation of knowledge. This is closely related to the cause-effect relationship.

## Lecture 2

The main methods of induction were:
* Mill's method of agreement: finding out qualities from positive instances (essence of presence)
* Mill's method of difference: by taking away the form, the quality is also taken away
* Mill's method of concomitant variation: the object of our inquiry is present in varying degrees

While Bacon worked on new science, he did not offer a complete theory of the universe. Mathematics and logic were thought to be the handmaids of physics.

Philosophy consists of human and civil/political philosophy. Man is a member of society, and human science focussed on psychology and physiology. Logic deals with reason and understanding, and ethics is about will, appetite, and affection.

Hobbes tried to impart more practical utility to science and philosophy. He argued in favour of a materialistic philosophy (as opposed to Descartes). He also supported the heliocentric view of Copernicus and Galileo. Hobbes' theory of knowledge says that reasoning is conceptual arithmetic, with logical addition/subtraction of concepts. The origin of all thoughts is senses, since sensation persists and memory is retained. These thoughts are regulated by desire. The mechanism responsible for causing sensuous experiences is the body.

Rationalism purports that reason is the foundation of knowledge, whereas empiricism says that experience is the foundation of knowledge.     
The empiricists also do not believe in a world beyond our own, such as heaven.

## Lecture 3

Descartes took mathematics as the model of his philosophical method, using induction and deduction. He tried to reconcile nature with the freedom of the human soul.    
Recall that metaphysics consists of the principle of knowledge concerning the principal attributes of God, immateriality of soul, and ideas.    
He spoke of self-evident truth, and placed importance on clear and certain knowledge. He claimed that knowledge cannot just be built on history, but also requires intervention of method. He wondered how philosophy could discover the truth in a manner similar to mathematics. His method was known as Descartes' _methodological skepticism_, and involved deductive and inductive/synthetic reasoning for indubitable truth.    
Truth in traditional scholastic systems are based on mass divergent opinions so he rejected them. Many of them are based on experiences, and senses may be deceiving. Even memory and its presentations can be deceptive. Sometimes, even the demonstrations of mathematics may be doubted.    
Now, if there is doubt, there must be a doubter. This activity of doubting is considered thinking, and this is stated as _res cogitans_ ("the mind is a thinking thing"). The most self-evident proposition is _cogito_ ("I think"), and this leads to the famous saying _dubito ergo cogito ergo sum_ ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am").

## Lecture 4

What is Descartes' arguments regarding God? Similar to how the self is innate, so is the idea of God. It is not derived from the external world. He says that he cannot himself cause the idea of God, a perfect and infinite being, so it must be something higher.
God as a perfect being must exist, and therefore must be self-caused. The causal inference from the idea of God to God himself is an _ontological_ argument. Genuine knowledge (such as God) is the result of reasoning from certain basal concepts/principles that are inherent in the mind itself. These are innate (or a priori).

How do we know that the world exists? Bodily causes such as pleasure/pain/appetites/sensations? However, sensations oten deceive us and desires/appetites can be misleading. The power endowed by God is to dispel such illusions. God is a completely truthful being, and our sensations must thus be caused by real bodies.    
God is said to be an absolute substance. The mind and body are _relative_ substances which exist independently. The smallest part of the body is corpuscles. Thought, will, or imagination is the essence of the mind. Extension is the essence of body.    
The mind is diametrically opposite to the body. The two substances are completely independent -- the mind has no extension and no body can think. The mind is conceived independent of the body. The mind is also autonomous, and is not interacted with by the body. The knowledge one has of their own mind precedes any corporeal thing.    
This is referred to as Descartes' dualism. The occasional causal relationship between mind and body is mediated through the pineal gland.

## Lecture 5

John Locke is well-known for his radical views on self and _social contract theory_. He refuted innate ideas, and claimed that it is necessary to examine out abilities and see what our understanding is. The mind must be conscious of innate principles, but the mind itself is a blank slate (_tabula rasa_). Knowledge is acquired through experience. Moral laws are not innate, and are not self-evident and universally recognized. For example, some tribes do not have the idea of God, showing that it is not innate.    
There are two sources of ideas: _sensation_ (sensuous experiences) and _reflection_ (mind's operations), both of which are ultimately derived from experience.    
By "idea", Locke means something that the mind directly apprehends, or something that is the immediate object of perception, thought, and understanding. Ideas can be simple or complex. The former consists of those that enter the mind by only one sense such as colour, sound, taste, cold, or solidity. The latter cocnsists of things like space, extension, figure, some of which are received by reflection. Finally, some ideas are received through both sensation and reflection, such as pleasure, pain, power, existence, unity, etc.

Qualities are the power that objects have in producing ideas. Primary qualities are things such as solidity, extension, figure, that are inherent in the obejct, whereas secondary qualities are things like sound, taste, and colour. Ideas of relations are combinations of multiple ideas and are complex.    
Locke also proposes "modes". The simple mode consists of variations of the same simpler idea (for example, days and years are simple modes of duration). Mixed modes are compounded of simple ideas of various kinds, put together to make a single one (for example, beauty is a composition of colour and figure, causing delight and pleasure in the beholder).

## Lecture 6

David Hume is well-known for his works _Treatise on Human Nature_ and _Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding_. He agrees with Descartes, Hobbes, and Locke in that genuine knowledge must be self-evident, but he finds no such knowledge anywhere other than mathematics, which merely analyses its own concepts.    
Hume's view is empirical, positivistic (knowledge is limited to the world of phenomena), agnostic (we know nothing of ultimates, substances, causes, soul, ego, external world, universe, etc.) and humanistic (the human mental world is the only legitimate sphere of science and inquiry).

The sciences of human nature are:
* _logic _deals with reasoning.
* _morals_ and criticism deals with our tastes and sentiments.
* _politics_ deals with how humans are united and dependent on each other.

Mathematics, natural philosophy, and natural religion are products of human thought/faculties. The existence of God is not because He is the creator of the universe, but because it is manufactured by human thought. Moral philosophy provides a foundation to other sciences by experience and observation. True metaphysics is the science of understanding.

All the materials of our thinking are derived from outward/inward impressions. "Impressions" means the more lively perceptions, such as when we hear or see or feel or love, namely all our sensations, passions, and emoitions as they make their first appearances in the soul. The inward perceptions are those that are internal (like the sensation of pain or hunger), and the outward perceptions are those that have external origin (like cold or heat). Desire, aversion, hope, and fear are impressions of reflection.    
All our thoughts are copies of such impressions. They are the less lively perceptions such as the faint/feeble perceptions of which we are conscious when we recall/reflect on sensations that arise in the soul from unknown causes, while inward impressions are frequently occasioned by ideas.    
Knowledge results from compounding the materials due to senses and experiences. We can also associate ideas by observing certain connections, regularities, or contiguities in time/place.

The idea of causation is not reached by any a priori reasoning. The mind cannot deduce the effect from a certain cause, and the study of cause and effect is a study of speculation and practice. We cannot demonstrate that a certain cause has a certain effect. The knowledge of causation is attained through observation and experience. This experience eventually produces a belief, which is an operation of the mind.

## Lecture 7

All reasoning concerning matters of fact are dependent on cause-and-effect relationships. The evidence is compared with mathematics. The uniformity of nature is a self-evident knowledge (the sun will rise tomorrow). However, even this does not constitute absolute certainty. Hume says that nothing is necessary, and we move from this to probabilities of occurrences instead.    
Practice is the best cure for skepticism, since being skeptical of everything would lead to no practical good.

Impressions and sensations appear and reappear in our experience. All we can do is to limit ourselves to these, compare our ideas and note their relations, then reasoning about these relations and attaining some kind of demonstrative knowledge. It finally boils down to noticing regularities in observations, leading to a custom, and drawing inferences from them.    
Passion is the source of understanding the world. 

## Lecture 8

A striking characteristic of Indian thought is its variety -- nearly every shade of speculation is included in it.    
Western philosophy is materialistic and seeks to understand the materials (even humans are counted as materials). In contrast, philosophy in India is spiritual, and this spirituality is what has enabled it to resist the ravages of time. The word _darshana_ means vision and also the instrument of vision. It stands for the direct, immediate, and intuitive vision of reality, the perception of truth, and also the means to realize these. _Atma va are drustavyah_ (see the self) is the keynote of all schools of Indian philosophy.

Vedas are known as _shrutis_ and knowledge. The poetic hymns of the Vedas unfold the seed of philosophical thinking which mature in the Upanishads. There was a transition from naturalism and anthropomorphic polytheism through transcendent monotheism  to immanent in the pre-Upanisadic philosopy.    
The personified forces of nature were changed into real gods (like _agni_ in the Yajurveda).    
The orthodox interpretation is that Vedas are authorless and eternal. Westerners interpret the Vedic seers as primitive and wondered at the charming beauty of nature and feared natural forces, but they were intellectual and intensely spiritual.

_Ekam satya vipra bahudha badanti_ (only one is real), but wise people declare that many things are real. _Purusa_ is all that was, is, and will be, and the real essence of God is one. The interpretation of Purusa varies across Vedas -- it is _uktha_ in the Rigveda, _agni_ in the Yajurveda, and _mahavrta_ in the Samveda. Purusa is the custodian of _Rta_, which is truth and the moral cosmic order. Rta is the binding soul of the universe, which units different things.    
A belief of monistic idealism is that of the immortality of the soul. It is self-possessed, self-proved, and full of bliss. Monistic idealism refers to the realization of the notion of ultimate truth/reality.

An important concept in the Upanishads is _atman_ and _brahman_. The notion of spirit has two dimensions, with the "universal" one (transcendence) being brahman and the particular one (immanence) being atman.

The self is in three types of sleep -- walking, dreaming, and dreamless. Our bodily self is that which in a walking sleep, our empirical self is that which is in a dreaming sleep, and the absolute/metaphysical self is that which is in a dreamless sleep. The body is perishable. The _chhandogya upanishad_ (a dialogue) is between Indra, Virochana, and Prajapati.    
He who is dreaming is free. In deep sleep, there is no subject to feel. Does this mean that the self is only an abstraction? The self appears to be unconscious. The self persists through all changes of their knower, and it cannot be known to any object (_Yajnavalka_ in _Brhadarnyaka Upanisad_).
