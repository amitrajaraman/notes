title: Lecture 1 - What is philosophy?
---

Philosophy is a humanistic discipline and is related to human life in an _epistemological_ sense. Epistemology means that it studies _knowledge_. It studies the underlying principle of reality.    
When one asks what a book is, what is the underlying character/essence of a book that makes it a book? The underlying principle of human existence leads to the discussion of _metaphysics_. Philosophy begins with metaphysics.
