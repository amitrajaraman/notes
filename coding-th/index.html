I primarily referred to Raymond Hill's book titled "A First Course in Coding Theory" and Venkatesan Guruswami, Atri Rudra, and Madhu Sudan's draft titled "Essential Coding Theory" (which can be found <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/atri/courses/coding-theory/book/">here</a>) while making these notes.
