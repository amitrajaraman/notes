Uniform generation problems are, in computational difficulty, intermediate between classical existence and counting problems. It is shown that exactly uniform generation of ‘efficiently verifiable’ combinatorial structures is reducible to approximate counting (and hence, is within the third level of the polynomial hierarchy). Natural combinatorial problems are presented which exhibit complexity gaps between their existence and generation, and between their generation and counting versions. It is further shown that for self-reducible problems, almost uniform generation and randomized approximate counting are inter-reducible, and hence, of similar complexity.}

The bound is O(n6 log4 n) for centrally symmpetric bodies and for polytopes with a polynomial number of facets, and O(n5 log4 n) for centrally symmetric polytopes with a polynomial number of facets. We also give an O(n6 log n) algorithm to sample a point from the uniform distribution over a convex body. Several tools are developed that may be interesting on their own. We extend results of Sinclair–Jerrum [43] and the authors [34] on the mixing rate of Markov chains from finite to arbitrary Markov chains. We also analyze the mixing rate of various random walks on convex bodies, in particular the random walk with steps from the uniform distribution over a unit ball. © 1993 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

    abstract = {Abstract Given a high dimensional convex body K⊆ℝn by a separation oracle, we can approximate its volume with relative error ε, using O*(n5) oracle calls. Our algorithm also brings the body into isotropic position. As all previous randomized volume algorithms, we use “rounding” followed by a multiphase Monte-Carlo (product estimator) technique. Both parts rely on sampling (generating random points in K), which is done by random walk. Our algorithm introduces three new ideas: the use of the isotropic position (or at least an approximation of it) for rounding; the separation of global obstructions (diameter) and local obstructions (boundary problems) for fast mixing; and a stepwise interlacing of rounding and sampling. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Random Struct.
