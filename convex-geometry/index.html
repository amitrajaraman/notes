title:	(High-Dimensional) Convex Geometry

<p>
The link to the report in PDF is <a href="Convex_Geometry.pdf">this</a>.

It is highly recommended that the reader have some understanding of measure theory and probability theory before reading.<br>
Sections 4 onwards assume a knowledge of discrete Markov chains (a more general theory of Markov chains is required from section 4.4 onwards, but we give the necessary definitions).<br>
Sections 5.2 onwards require a basic knowledge of martingale theory and stochastic calculus, a brief overview of which can be found <a href="https://amitrajaraman.github.io/notes/prob-th/stoch.pdf">here</a>.

I primarily referred to 
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="http://library.msri.org/books/Book31/files/ball.pdf">"An Elementary Introduction to Modern Convex Geometry" by Keith Ball</a> for sections 1 through 3,
	<li>
		"Lectures on Discrete Geometry" by Jiří Matoušek for most of section 3.2 and several scattered parts in sections 1 through 3,
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~rojas/simonvitzvolumehigh.pdf">"How to compute the volume in high dimension?" by Miklós Simonovits</a> and several referenced papers for sections 4.1 and 4.2,
	<li>

</ul>
and many referenced papers from section 4.3 onwards.
