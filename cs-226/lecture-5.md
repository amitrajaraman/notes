The supply (demand) curve does not take demand (supply) into consideration. _Market supply_ is the sum of all the individual supplies for sellers of a particular good/service. Individual supply curves are added horizontally (the capacities sum up) to get the market supply curve.    
Observe that the supply increases as the price increases.

Price represents moving along the supply curve (change in supply). A shift of the curve to the right corresponds to an increase in supply (change in quantity supplied). The factors mentioned in the previous lecture are

* Input prices - Shifts supply curve to the left.
* Technology - An improvement in technology leads to the supply curve shifting to the right.
* Expectations - If the price is expected to increase, then the curve shifts to the left because they start hoarding the product. This assumes the good is durable, if it is perishable then we need to sell it by the expiry date anyway. Note that the curve will shift to the right of the norm in the future.
* Number of sellers - If the number of sellers increase, there is more horizontal summation so it shifts to the right.

_Equilibrium_ is the situation where the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. The _equilibrium price_ and _equilibtium quantity_ are the price and quantity at which the supply and demand curves intersect (at the equilibrium). 

If the price is higher than the equilibrium price, then the supply is high and the demand is low. This is known as an _excess-supply situation_. The excess supply is known as the _surplus_. Since the sellers need to clear their excess, the price decreases until the equilibrium is reached.    
Similarly, if the price is lower than the equilibrium price, we are in an _excess-demand situation_. The excess demand is known as the _shortage_. Here, the sellers realize that they need to sell more and they drive up the price until the equilibrium is reached.    
This is Adam Smith's "invisible hand" mentioned in the first lecture.    
The law of supply and demand claims that the price of any good adjusts to bring the supply and demand into balance.

Note that the supply and demand curves alone do not determine the equilibrium, we require both of them.

We can use the earlier discussion to analyze how various factors influence the equilibrium. In digital markets, since information transfer is very fast, it doesn't take too long to attain the new equilibrium if the equilibrium shifts.
